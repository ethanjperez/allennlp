But the words , Carl Walter spoke that day , came back to me years later , and ever since have been of great value to me . Carl Walter was my piano teacher . During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I was doing . I said three or four hours a day . \" Do you practice , an hour at a time ? \" \" I try to . \" \" Well , don ' t , \" he exclaimed . \" When you grow up , time won ' t come in long stretches . Practice in minutes , whenever you can find them five or ten before school , after lunch , between household tasks . Spread the practice through the day , and piano - playing will become a part of your life . \" When I was teaching at Columbia , I wanted to write , but class periods , theme - reading , and committee meetings filled my days and evenings . For two years I got practically nothing down on paper , and my excuse was that I had no time . Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said . During the next week I conducted an experiment . Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied , I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so . To my astonishment , at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision , later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method . Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever , in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use .

She could not put pressure on the heels of her feet , so she walked on tiptoe , and when the pain became unbearable , I carried her . Jenny was fortunate , though , because she did not suffer the deformities , often associated with JRA . All through grade school , and on into high school , Jenny suffered , yet never complained . She took her medicine , and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels , and hold her until the pain eased . But , as soon as she could stand the pain , Jenny , immediately , carried on , as though she were pain - free . She wore a smile on her face , a song on her lips , and a love and acceptance of others . That was simply amazing . She ran , when she could run . She played when she could play , and she danced when she could dance . And , when she could do none of these things , she took her medicine , and she waited until she could . Jenny , a beautiful girl with warm brown eyes , was never a cheerleader . She never competed in a sport . She joined the band . She won a place in the Govemor ' s School for the Arts ; yet , no one in the Charleston , South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny . The perimeters were , simply , not in place to deal with a student , who was both active and disabled . Jenny continued to have one operation after another on her ears , all through school . Her hearing improved to 60 % , and she taught herself to read lips . At school she was popular , attending every football game to cheer the team on . She carried her pillow everywhere she went , so that she could reduce the pain when she sat down . Then came her senior year in high school . She liked school activities , especially sports . So she began to bombard the school football coach . Finally the coach gave in , with the warning , \" If you miss ONE game , you ' re out ! \" So , Jenny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team . She carried big buckets of water to her teammates . She bandaged knees and ankles before every game . She gave inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history . When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games , one team member Jack explained , \" Well , when you ' ve been knocked down , and you can ' t seem to move , you look up and see Jenny Lewis , walking across the field , dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow . It makes anything the rest of us may suffer seem pretty unimportant . \" At the Senior Awards ceremony , Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston . Her favorite scholarship , however , was a small one from the Charleston Women ' s Club .

On Friday , I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives - - challenges shared by many of you .

But the gains of a growing economy aren ' t yet felt by everyone . So we ' ve got to harness this momentum , and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead . In recent weeks , I ' ve talked about these choices , from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing . Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . Right now , women make up almost half of our workers .

And we should be choosing policies that benefit women - - because that benefits all of us . Women deserve fair pay . Even though it ' s 2014 , there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work . We don ' t have second - class citizens in this country - - we shouldn ' t in the workplace , either . So let ' s make sure women earn equal pay for equal work , and have a fair shot at success . Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby , an ailing parent , or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship . So let ' s make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave . Pregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly .

He ' s very lucky with his timing . He grew up having other kittens to play and socialize with , and was used to people from the moment he was born since there are always kids hanging around the barn . He was a favorite amongst the students at the barn . However , when it came time to find the kittens homes , no one knew where Jack would end up . That ' s when I got an e - mail from my friend . All she asked was \" Do you still want one of the kittens ? There ' s one here with no eyes and no one can take him . \" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten . When we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around , sniffing everything . He went through a time when he could climb the stairs , but couldn ' t get down . He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him . Every now and then when he gets disoriented he ' ll stop and cry . But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn ' t long before he finds his way back to us . Also , a few weeks after getting Jack , we got a new barn cat named Bear . I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise . He loves to run ( at top speed ! ) around the backyard and gardens . Bear and Jack have become best friends . Jack always knows when Bear is around . He ' ll run across the yard straight to Bear and wrap his front legs around his neck in a big hug . When they ' re tired they ' ll lie down in the grass together . Jack is truly an inspiration . I ' ve owned a lot of kittens in my life , but Jack is the happiest , most playful of them all .

Work hard to get good grades . Don ' t sweat about one bad grade , but always strive to do your best . 2 . Get involved , and stay involved , in extracurricular activities . Sports , clubs , drama , bands and orchestras - these often count toward a student ' s overall scholarship application evaluation . The same goes for paid ( or unpaid ) work experience . 3 . Begin your scholarship research early - by your sophomore or junior year of high school , if possible . Make special note of application deadlines , as they can vary from late summer to late spring . 4 . Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for - several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money . * During the application process 1 . Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program ' s focus ( community service , subject interest ) . Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind . 2 . Answer questions as they are asked . Don ' t go off the topic . 3 . If there is a financial component to the application , make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility . 4 . Take your time . Write down everything you can think of for each question , then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off . 5 . Don ' t wait until the last minute to complete your application , especially if you are applying online .

The answer came to me in an instant . It ' s not the one I gave , because the situation was not right . As a lawyer in the entertainment industry , I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well - known people , but here ' s the true answer : The most important thing I ' ve ever done occurred on October 8 , 1990 . I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn ' t seen for a while . Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other ' s lives . He and his wife had just had a baby boy , who was keeping them up at night . While we were playing , a car came screaming up the road toward the courts . It was my friend ' s father , who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital . In a flash my friend was in the car and gone , disappearing in a cloud of dust . For a moment I just stood there , paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do . Follow my friend to the hospital ? There was nothing I could accomplish there , I convinced myself . My friend ' s son was in the care of doctors and nurses , and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome . Be there for moral support ? Well , maybe . But my friend and his wife both had large families , and I knew they ' d be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support , whatever happened . All I could do at the hospital , I decided , was to get in the way . Also , I had planned a full day with my family , who were waiting for me to get home . So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later . As I started my car , I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts . I now faced another problem . I couldn ' t leave the keys in the truck . So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys . When I arrived , I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting . As I had thought , the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife . I went in and stood by the door , trying to decide what to do next . Soon a doctor appeared . He approached my friend and his wife , and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died . For a long time the two held each other and cried , unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence . After they had calmed themselves , the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son . My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families . When they reached the door , my friend saw me standing in the corner . He came over and hugged me and started to cry . My friend ' s wife hugged me , too , and said , \" Thanks for being here . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . It ' s the most important thing I have ever done . The experience taught me two lessons . First : The most important thing I ' ve ever done happened when I was completely helpless . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Something terrible was happening to people I cared about , and I was powerless to change the outcome . All I could do was standing by and watching it happen . And yet it was critical that I do just that - - - just be there when someone needed me . Second : The most important thing I ' ve done almost didn ' t happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . These skills are critical for lawyers . When people come to us for help , they ' re often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically . But while learning to think , I almost forget how to feel . Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital .

I have to draw every single day of my life . I have to draw about 20 ideas . My advice is to put aside a certain amount of time every day and make you draw or whatever , especially when you don ' t feel like it . Only in this way will you be able to perfect your talent . The first step you take is to go to your local library and ask for the publications issued in the current years . When you get these publications , try to find the names of the top people concerned and their presidents . After you find these , write down their names and addresses . Keep this list and update it every year . Next thing you want to do is to create at least 40 cartoons . Get a grid from one of the strips in the newspapers , enlarge it to whatever size you wish and draw inside this grid . Now take the best 20 of your ideas and make them into finished pieces . To do this , you would want to copy them in ink because if you were a professional cartoonist , that was what you should do . Now you can reduce the size of the finished cartoons to fit onto a regular comic ' s page . By comparing yours with the others already in print , it gives you a good idea of clarity to your cartoon . The next step is to write letters to presidents of the publication . In the letters , explain who you think would read your work , or in other words , what group do you think you would target . After you complete these , send all of your information enclosed with letters in the appropriate envelope . Now as soon as you send out these letters , start to create a brand new strip with all new characters . Don ' t _ because if your idea gets turned down then you will give up . And always remember . If you receive a rejection from any of them , keep in mind that you are working on something better .

It ' s a time when information is of primary importance . It ' s a time when new information technologies are fundamentally transforming the world in every aspect . Among the changes , which have come upon modern society , the ones in education are probably the most obvious and influential . New information technologies are accelerating changes in education , at the same time presenting revolutionary tools with the potential to make education more efficient and more effective than ever . The application of new information technologies has remarkably promoted the process of education . Online learning is probably the best case in point . As is often the case with \" technology \" , online learning may appear to be horrible ; it can sound like alphabet soup sometimes . Now let ' s see whether you can understand all this . You can participate in CBT at a CLC via the convenience of IDL . What does it all mean ? Let me translate : GBT - - Computer - Based Training ; CLC - - Computer Learning Center ; IDL - - Interactive Distance Learning . Sound complicated ? Not really . Online learning is much less complicated than it seems . Students can learn at any time , anywhere , at any speed . They can make their own learning schedules and follow their own paths to suit their lifestyles . In my university , every semester there ' re several online courses available , which need no class meetings or paper materials . The only thing I have to do is just to get online regularly as I wish , and download necessary learning materials . Then everything I need to know about the course is only a click away . But online learning is not perfect ; it ' s like the microwave oven : it does some things better , but it is not a complete replacement for the traditional model . The traditional classroom model for education and learning is hard to leave behind . Because humans are social creatures , there ' re times when we need to see each other face - to - face for interactive learning . A social and personal connection often builds effective teams , solves problems , and inspires confidence .

Late at night , he beat on the door , pleading to my mother to open it . He was on his way home from drinking , gambling , or some combination thereof , misspending money that we could have used and wasting time that we desperately needed . It was the late - 1970s . My parents were separated . My mother was now raising a group of boys on her own . My father spouted off about what he planned to do for us , buy for us . In fact , he had no intention of doing anything . As a father who was supposed to love us , in fact , he lacked the understanding of what it truly meant to love a child - - or to hurt one . To him , this was a harmless game that kept us excited and begging . In fact , it was a cruel , corrosive lie . I lost faith in his words and in him . I wanted to stop caring , but I couldn ' t . Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . Maybe it was the pain and guilt associated with a life of misfortune . Who knows . Whatever it was , it stole him from us , and particularly from me . While my brothers talked about breaking and fixing things , I spent many of my evenings reading and wondering . My favorite books were a set of encyclopedias given by my uncle . They allowed me to explore the world beyond my world , to travel without leaving , to dream dreams greater than my life would otherwise have supported . But losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely lost to my father . Not understanding me , he simply ignored me - - not just emotionally , but physically as well . Never once did he hug me , never once a pat on the back or a hand on the shoulder or a tousling of the hair . My best memories of him were from his episodic attempts at engagement with us . During the longest of these episodes , once every month or two , he would come pick us up and drive us down the interstate to Trucker ' s Paradise , a seedy , smoke - filled , truck stop with gas pumps , a convenience store , a small dining area and a game room through a door in the back . My dad gave each of us a handful of quarters , and we played until they were gone .

However , before you are able to get your pet to a veterinarian , knowing some basic first aid can help . Bite Wounds Approach the pet carefully to avoid getting bitten . Wear a mask for the animal and then check the wound . Clean the wound with large amounts of saline . If these are not available , then regular water may be used . Wrap large open wounds to keep them clean . Bleeding Apply firm , direct pressure over the bleeding area until the bleeding stops . Hold the pressure for at least 10 minutes . Avoid bandages that cut off circulation . _ Check to see if the animal is choking on a foreign object . If an animal is not breathing , place it on a firm surface with its left side up . Check for a heartbeat . If you hear a heartbeat but not breathing , close the animal ' s mouth and breathe directly into its nose - - not the mouth - - until the chest expands . Repeat 12 to 15 times per minute . Burns Wash the burn immediately with large amounts of cool , running water . Apply an ice pack for 15 - - 20 minutes . Do not place an ice pack directly on the skin . Wrap the pack in a light towel or other cover . If the animal has large quantities of dry chemicals on it skin , brush them off .

Memorizing phone numbers It was annoying to remember numbers . Now we simply add them to our contacts list . That usually works well unless our device is lost , stolen , or damaged . No one can be expected to remember all their contact numbers . What we can do is memorize 5 of our most important contact numbers . This should include a mixture of family , friends and business . If you ' re really ambitious you can memorize 5 contacts for each category . 2 . Map - reading skills The convenience and effectiveness of GPS guidance systems and digital maps generated by search engines is unquestionable . They ' ve definitely made our lives easier . What we don ' t get from using these devices and applications is the increased ability to understand spatial orientation and navigation . To renew or acquire those skills , try using physical maps to plan your next trip . After a few trips , you ' ll be pleasantly surprised with how useful a physical map can be . 3 . Photography Even amateur photography requires a basic learning about lighting , depth , and composition . This is true for digital photography . Most smart cameras automatically make these adjustments . We no longer have to learn the art of photography . On most devices , this is easily changed by turning off the automatic settings . Experiment with setting by hand the scene modes , lighting , and zoom . You just may learn that you ' re a \" true photographer \" . 4 . Reading comprehension The primary cause is E - reader . They ' re convenient and can store thousands of books . But there ' s evidence that E - reader makes it more difficult for readers to keep and recall information they just read . Don ' t worry ! What we should do is make an effort to read printed books . This will be especially helpful when seeking information we need for academic or career purposes . 5 .

The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time , but it makes a good story now . What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent fate in court . It happened in February about twelve years ago . I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October . I was still living at home at the time .

Utoya Island was a youth camp run by Norway ' s Labor Party . One day in July , a heavily armed , right - wing extremist stepped onto the island and began shooting at random . Sixty - nine people died , over 100 were wounded ; almost all , young people . This month , artist Jonas Dahlberg was appointed to create a memorial . He described to us the experience he imagines for those who come to the island . DAHLBERG : You start your walk through a forest of evergreens on a wooden pathway . After a while , this pathway starts to go down into the landscape . MONTAGNE : Down into the landscape , and into a short tunnel . When you come out , you are unable to go any farther . You can ' t get to the tip of the island because it has been cut off . So all you can do is look across a narrow channel of water at what is now a wall of polished stone , carved with the names of the dead . DAHLBERG : It becomes almost like a gravestone . You cannot reach it . It ' s close enough to be able to read , but it ' s forever lost for your possibility to reach . MONTAGNE : It ' s being called _ . Exactly what do you mean by that ? DAHLBERG : During my first site visit , the experience of seeing those gunshots - - and you can see it was like being in an open wound . And it took me to a stage of deep sadness where it was hard to breathe . So I didn ' t want to illustrate loss ; I wanted to make actual loss . It ' s just a cut through the island . MONTAGNE : On the day of the massacre , just hours before launching his shooting on the island , the killer set off a bomb in downtown Oslo , leaving eight people dead . As those events were unfolding , artist Jonas Dahlberg had been out with his brother , and stopped in at a seaside village . DAHLBERG : In the harbor , it was silent , and this is the higher end of summer . So , it ' s normally a very lively place . And it was total silence there ; and it was a very , very strange feeling in the whole small village . And it ' s totally impossible to grasp what is going on . And then it just kept on . It ' s still almost impossible to understand it . It ' s also one of the reasons why it ' s so important with memorials for these kind of things . It ' s to maybe help a little bit to understand what was happening . So it ' s not just about remembering . It ' s also about trying to just understand .

Why do we blame the black cat when we saw the low score of the test ? These habits have been referred to as magical thinking and can be found everywhere in daily life . For example , a person wishes something bad for an annoying colleague . Or parents pray for a safe fight when seeing their son off . Psychologically helpful In examining these habits , scientists decided to search for a reason for humans ' belief in magical powers . Psychologists have their own approach to the question . \" I think in part it ' s because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts , and thus likely to overestimate their connection to outside events . \" said Emily Pronin , a psychologist in the prefix = st1 / US . For people who are uncertain of their own abilities or slow to take action , magical thinking can be a great help , explained Dr . Daniel Wegner , a professor psychology at Harvard . Feeling that their own thoughts can control things can help people fight depression . A trait gained through evolution But evolutionists have their own ideas . Two schools of evolutionary thought have come up with reasons by analyzing the development of humans . They are the \" adaptationists \" and the \" byproduct theorists \" . The adaptationists say that belief in magical powers makes people feel better , less worried about difficulties , more focused on the future , and more willing to care for themselves . People with a strong faith ( in something ) have a better chance of surviving a tough environment or competition . But in byproduct theory , magical thinking is a product of our psychological features . \" We automatically look for an explanation of why things happen , \" explains Justin Barrett , a psychologist , The brain , therefore , has evolved to make quick judgments about causation . So we often link two events based on nothing more than coincidence . For example , \" I was just thinking about looking up my old high school girlfriend when she suddenly called me . \" Another psychological feature is the theory of mind . We recognize that there could be an unseen power of mind affecting the outcome of an incident . Byproduct theorists claim that because of these features , we are born with a tendency to believe in our magical thinking . But we need to confine our magical thinking , warn psychologists .

He knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day . They would walk past him and laugh . They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday . The thought burned him like fire . He put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned . Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him . But there was nothing of value in his pockets - - nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom . So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea At this dark and hopeless moment , a wonderful idea came to him . It filled his mind with a great , bright light . Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash . While Tom was working , Ben Rogers appeared . Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street . As he walked along , he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat . First he shouted loudly , like a boat captain . Then he said \" Ding - Dong - Dong \" , \" Ding - Dong - Dong \" again and again , like the bell of a riverboat . And he made other strange noises . When he came close to Tom , he stopped .

He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly . He looked at it , and all joy left him . The fence was long and high . He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence . He repeated the operation . He felt he could not continue and sat down . He knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day . They would walk past him and laugh . They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday . The thought burned him like fire . He put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned . Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him . But there was nothing of value in his pockets - - nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom . So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea At this dark and hopeless moment , a wonderful idea came to him . It filled his mind with a great , bright light . Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash . While Tom was working , Ben Rogers appeared . Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street . As he walked along , he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat . First he shouted loudly , like a boat captain . Then he said \" Ding - Dong - Dong \" , \" Ding - Dong - Dong \" again and again , like the bell of a riverboat . And he made other strange noises . When he came close to Tom , he stopped . Tom went on whitewashing . He did not look at Ben . Ben stared a moment and then said : \" Hello ! I ' m going swimming , but you can ' t go , can you ? \" No answer . Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist . Ben came nearer . Tom ' s mouth watered for the apple , but he kept on working . Ben said , \" Hello , old fellow , you ' ve got to work , hey ? \" Tom turned suddenly and said , \" Why , it ' s you , Ben ! I wasn ' t noticing . \" \" Say - - I ' m going swimming . Don ' t you wish you could ? But of course you ' d rather work - - wouldn ' t you ? Of course you would . \" Tom looked at the boy a bit , and said \" What do you call work ? \" \" Why , isn ' t that work ? \" Tom went back to his whitewashing , and answered carelessly . \" Well , maybe it is , and maybe it isn ' t . All I know is , it suits Tom Sawyer . \" \" Oh come , now , you don ' t mean to say that you like it ? \" The brush continued to move . \" Like it ? Well , I don ' t see why I shouldn ' t like it . Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day ? \" Ben stopped eating his apple . Tom moved his brush back and forth , stepped back to look at the result , added a touch here and there , and stepped back again . Ben watched every move and got more and more interested . Soon he said , \" Say , Tom , let me whitewash a little . \" Tom thought for a moment , was about to agree ; but he changed his mind . \" No - - no - - it won ' t do , Ben . You see , Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect . It has got to be done very carefully . I don ' t think there is one boy in a thousand , maybe two thousand , that can do it well enough . \" \" No - - is that so ? Oh come , now - - let me just try . Only just a little . \" \" Ben , I ' d like to , but if it isn ' t done right , I ' m afraid Aunt Polly . . . \" \" Oh , I ' ll be careful . Now let me try . Say - - I ' ll give you the core of my apple . \" \" Well , here - - No , Ben , now don ' t . I ' m afraid . . . \" \" I ' ll give you all of it . \" Tom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face , but joy in his heart . And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun , Tom sat under a tree , eating the apple , and planning how to get more help . There were enough boys . Each one came to laugh , but remained to whitewash . By the time Ben was tired , Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite ; and when Billy was tired , Johnny bought in for a dead rat - - and so on , hour after hour . And when the middle of the afternoon came , Tom had won many treasures . And he had not worked . He had had a nice idle time all the time , with plenty of company - and the fence had been whitewashed three times .

Middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are . The best students won ' t only have high marks . They will also be kids who don ' t dye their hair , smoke or drink . The following are some of the new rules . Tell the truth . Have you ever copied others ' work in an exam ? Don ' t do it again if you did it before ! That ' s not something an honest student should do . If you have played computer games for two hours in your room , don ' t tell your parents you have done your homework . Do more at school . Good students love animals and care for other people . April is a bird - loving month in China . Did your school do anything to celebrate ? If so , you should join it ! In this way , you can learn more about animals and how to protect them . When more people work together , you can get more fun . Have you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost ? Only working together can make your team stronger . Be friendly to the people you are with . Try to think of others , not only yourself . Be open to new ideas . Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon ? Maybe you ' ll discover the truth someday . Don ' t look down on new ideas . Everyone ' s ideas are important . You should welcome them , because new ideas make life better for everyone . Protect yourself . Has anyone ever taken money from one of your classmates ? Don ' t let it happen to you . If you have to go home late , you should let your parents know . Use the Internet carefully .

My marks in school were miserable and , the thing was , I didn ' t know enough to really care . My older bother and I lived with Mom in an ugly multi - family house in Detroit . We watched TV every night . The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses ' hoofs from \" Wagon Train \" or \" Cheyenne \" , and laughter from \" I Love Lucy \" , or \" Mister Ed \" . After supper , we ' d lie on Mom ' s bed and stare for hours at the TV screen . But one day Mom changed our world forever . She turned off the TV . Our mother had only been able to get through third grade . But , she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time . She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books . So she came home one day , switched off the TV , sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves . \" You boys are going to read two books every week , \" she said . \" And you ' re going to write a report on what you read . \" We moaned ( , ) and complained about how unfair it was . Besides , we didn ' t have any books in the house other than Mom ' s Bible . But she explained that we would go where the books were : \" I ' ll drive you to the library . \" So pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library . I wandered reluctantly among the children ' s books . I loved animals , so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals , I started leafing through them . The first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder . It was about beavers . For the first time in my life I was lost in another world . No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home . It didn ' t dawn on me at the time , but the experience was quite different from watching TV . There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes . And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page . Soon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world . I moved from animals to plants , and then to rocks . Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds , and I was free to go anywhere in them . Along the way a funny thing happened : I started to know things . Teachers started to notice it too . I got to the point where I couldn ' t wait to get home to my books . Now my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children ' s Center in Baltimore . Sometimes I still can ' t believe my life ' s journey , from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position , which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery .

In a remarkable turn of events , Apple bought NeXT , I returned to Apple , and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple ' s current renaissance .

I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down . I even thought about running away from the valley . But something slowly began to dawn on me - - I still loved what I did . The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit . I had been rejected , but I was still in love . And so I decided to start over .

Pixar went on to create the world ' s first computer animated feature film , Toy Story , and is now the most successful animation studio in the world . In a remarkable turn of events , Apple bought NeXT , I returned to Apple , and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple ' s current renaissance .

But one day in a train something did happen . I do not mean that I was hurt : no one was hurt . I do my work in a hot country far away from England . Every September I go there to do my business , and every July I come back to England to have a rest . So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova , and at Mendova I catch my ship . There is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova , and it suits me well . It goes as far as Endoran , but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in . It is called The Flying Bluebird . It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning , and it is never late . A ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven , and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well . I always travel by it , and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship . That is more than enough time . Well , one September night , I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual . The train leaves Paris at nine o ' clock every night , and I was in my place soon after half past eight . There were three or four people there with me , but very soon a lot of others got into the train . When no more people could sit down , they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor .

How much money do they pay you every year ? How much do you have in the bank ?

But one day in a train something did happen . I do not mean that I was hurt : no one was hurt . I do my work in a hot country far away from England . Every September I go there to do my business , and every July I come back to England to have a rest . So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova , and at Mendova I catch my ship . There is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova , and it suits me well . It goes as far as Endoran , but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in . It is called The Flying Bluebird . It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning , and it is never late . A ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven , and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well . I always travel by it , and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship . That is more than enough time . Well , one September night , I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual . The train leaves Paris at nine o ' clock every night , and I was in my place soon after half past eight . There were three or four people there with me , but very soon a lot of others got into the train . When no more people could sit down , they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor . In a short time the corridor was full too , and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train . I could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows , but they could not get in , and the train left Paris without them . The man sitting next to me started to ask all kinds of questions : \" Where do you work ? How long does it take you to get there ? Are you married ? How many children do you have ? How much money do they pay you every year ? How much do you have in the bank ? How much do you spend every month ? \" He asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers , and at last he stopped and began to read the paper . I usually sleep quite well in the train , but this time I slept only a little . There were too many people , and there were too many things : small bags , large bags , coats , hats , boxes , newspapers and food . As usual , we got angry about the window . Most people wanted it shut , and two of us wanted it open . But that always happens . It was shut all night , as usual . When I awoke in the early morning I felt hot and dirty , and glad that the journey was reaching its end . At seven minutes past nine The Flying Bluebird stopped . We were at Mendova , and I stood up thankfully . I took my two suitcases , held one in each hand , and tried to move towards the door into the corridor . In order to get out of the train , I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end . There was no other way out . I could not even into the corridor . There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet , and three men were standing in my way . I felt a touch of fear . I had to get out , you see ; I had to catch my ship , which left at half past eleven . And the train did not stop again until it reached Endoran , two hundred miles away . \" I must get out ! \" I cried . Everyone there understood me , but no one could move . At last I was able to put one foot over the suitcase on the floor , and I nearly reached the door into the corridor . But then , very slowly , the train began to move . It was taking me away ! \" Stop ! \" I cried . \" I want to get out ! \" But no one outside the train could hear me , and the people inside did not care much . The train moved a little faster . What could I do ? I was not even in the corridor . Fear made me think quickly . In front of my eyes , just , above the door , was a notice that told everyone how to stop the train . I had to pull an iron thing near the notice . I did not waste time . I pulled it . Well , _ That was to show everyone that there was something wrong . It was not a small sound . Possibly the men in my ship two miles away could hear it . Then the train stopped . No one likes to stop a train if there is no need . But I had to catch my ship .

Below are some tips that will help you live a wonderful life . 1 . Keep a Positive Attitude . Enjoy what you have and work on getting the things you desire . Psychologists believe that optimism is a good defense against unhappiness , so it is better to keep your optimism alive . Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder , so be happy . 2 . Don ' t Be Afraid to Take Risks . Life is all about taking risks , and that ' s the exciting part of it . Challenges and failure are part of life . Once you learn how to take risks , you ' ll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by . 3 . You only have one life , so make it worthwhile . Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present . 4 . List the Things You Want to Do . Stop lazing around and give yourself something to be busy with . Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline , not to stress you out , but to remind you of your goals . So don ' t put limits to yourself because you ' ll never know what may happen . 5 . Try Out Something New .

They are wrong . Everyone has imagination , but most of us , once we became adults , forget how to access it . Creativity isn ' t always connected with great works of art or ideas . People at work and in their free time routinely think of creative ways to solve problems . Maybe you have a goal to achieve , a tricky question to answer or you just want to expand your mind ! Here are three techniques to help you . This technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them . First , think about the problem you have to solve or the job you need to do . Then find an image , word , idea or object , for example , a candle . Write down all the ideas / words associated with candles : light , fire , matches , wax , night , silence , etc . Think of as many as you can . The next stage is to relate the ideas to the job you have to do . So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present ; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night . Imagine that normal limitations don ' t exist . You have as much time / space / money , etc . as you want . Think about your goal and the new possibilities . If , for example , your goal is to learn to ski , you can now practice skiing every day of your life ( because you have the time and the money ) . Now adapt this to reality . Maybe you can practice skiing every day in December , or every Monday in January . Look at the situation from a different point of view .

But they couldn ' t get used to it . What was it ? It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time . This went on for more than a year . Sometimes the quakes were very small . Only certain instruments could pick them up . At other times , the quakes damaged houses and land . The people were always afraid . They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking . People all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming . But an earthquake is almost always a surprise . Under the surface of the Earth , huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other . The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes . Some scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals . It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming . In 1969 , animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day . Swans flew out of their pond . A panda sat down , covered its eyes with its paws , and groaned . The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen . And it did . An earthquake struck . What was it that the animals sensed ? Scientists are trying to find out . Keeping close track of the Earth ' s magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help . A few years ago , in Hollister , CA , scientists kept a record of the area ' s magnetic pull . For one week , the force grew stronger . Then it weakened suddenly . A day later , an earthquake struck . It may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen . But it will be much harder to stop one from happening . Many scientists think that the Earth ' s covering is not smooth . They say the earth ' s \" skin \" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates . Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates . Under the Earth ' s crust , or plates , is hot rock . The plates float on top of this rock . Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust . What happens then ? A volcano is born ! More often , the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other , causing earthquakes to happen . ( Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together . ) Sometimes , the plates end up on top of each other . When this happens , the land above may look strange .

But they couldn ' t get used to it . What was it ? It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time . This went on for more than a year . Sometimes the quakes were very small . Only certain instruments could pick them up . At other times , the quakes damaged houses and land . The people were always afraid . They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking . People all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming . But an earthquake is almost always a surprise . Under the surface of the Earth , huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other . The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes . Some scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals . It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming . In 1969 , animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day . Swans flew out of their pond . A panda sat down , covered its eyes with its paws , and groaned . The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen . And it did . An earthquake struck . What was it that the animals sensed ? Scientists are trying to find out . Keeping close track of the Earth ' s magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help . A few years ago , in Hollister , CA , scientists kept a record of the area ' s magnetic pull . For one week , the force grew stronger . Then it weakened suddenly . A day later , an earthquake struck . It may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen . But it will be much harder to stop one from happening . Many scientists think that the Earth ' s covering is not smooth . They say the earth ' s \" skin \" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates . Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates . Under the Earth ' s crust , or plates , is hot rock . The plates float on top of this rock . Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust . What happens then ? A volcano is born ! More often , the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other , causing earthquakes to happen . ( Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together . ) Sometimes , the plates end up on top of each other . When this happens , the land above may look strange . Seen from the air , there seems to be a long scar in the Earth . This is called a fault . The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth .

Strong feelings aren ' t something you display in public . So , you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief at a Chinese funeral . My editorial team leader died recently after a short illness . He was 31 . The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset . A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk . Somehow we got through the day ' s work . The next day was the funeral . Our big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears . She carried on , in Chinese of course , but at the end said in English : \" There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven . \" Next came a long - term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion . Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke . Sorrow is spreading . Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably . Finally , the man ' s mother , supported between two women , addressed her son in his coffin . At one point , the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up . We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket . Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap . At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion . In the UK , families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral . Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair . It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment , which is what many of us do in the West . Afterwards , a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained by Chinese standards . In some rural areas , she said , people used to be paid to mourn noisily . This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens . But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief - stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank , in Afghanistan , Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world . Chinese grief is no different . I realized that it ' s the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world . It was our newspaper ' s production day . We were bussed back to the office to resume work . No more deadlines for our former colleague , but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print . The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work . We relaxed , smiled , joked . There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague . Enough sorrow had been shed already .

One might find them playing unusual musical instruments , shopping at second - hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways . They call themselves hipsters . Being \" hip \" used to mean following the latest fashion . But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \" cool \" . Hipsters value independent thinking , progressive politics , an appreciation of creativity and intelligence . Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream . However , their culture has become quite trendy . This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox . \" I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt , \" says Ben Polson , a college student at Brown University in the US . Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity , especially regarding music . When lesser - known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one . There is a famous hipster saying that goes : I used to like that band before it got popular . According to Polson , bands ' music changes when they go mainstream . They become \" less experimental , doing things just to save popularity and fans . The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity . \" Many young adults have started to view hipsters ' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset themselves . This has led to specialized brands , stores and music for the hipster position . Ironically , some such stores , including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel , have gained mainstream popularity . This has seemingly diluted the anti - mainstream culture . \" A lot of people that are self - defined hipsters aren ' t really hipsters , they ' re just trying to conform to the non - conformist to seem cooler , \" says Amanda Leopold , a college student from Oberlin College , US . Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist , she refuses to classify herself as a hipster . There is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label . To some , to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints . To others , it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music . The former constantly strives for uniqueness , while the latter strives not to be mainstream . And yet , the movement is gaining mainstream popularity . \" It ' s kind of the trend these days ; _ \" says Leopold . \" There have been hipsters since the seventies . It ' s only become popular recently . \" Hipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture . But are they really beyond material comforts ? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much ? Christy Wampole , an associate professor of literature at Princeton University , US , is not so sure . She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery .

And both are so dissimilar ! What are the differences between friendship and love ? Is platonic friendship possible between persons of opposite sex ? Let us try and understand . What is friendship ? Why do we call a person our friend ? When do we call someone a very good friend ? If we care for a person , if we are always ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person , they are our good friends . We can always count upon our good friends in an emergency . We are always sure that our friend will understand why we acted in a certain way . We need not explain anything to our very good friends . The friendship is so deep and the relationship is so close , that most of the things are automatically understood by our friends . What about love ? In a relationship of deep love , all the sharing that we discussed above are taken for granted . But love transcends ( , ) all these . During love , we are attached with a particular person , while in friendship , one may have many friends . A loving relationship makes one so much attached to the other , that one gets pained if his / her beloved is hurt ! Love also involves a physical element . Friendship does not have that . This is a vital difference . Nature gives us love so that the species can go forward . Nature does not give us friendship . Your heart beats will never increase in expectation of meeting your friend . You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend .

Skaar was working late in her office at the First Internet bank of California . By 10 : 45 that night she was almost ready to go home when the phone rang . Picking it up , she heard a guard shouting . There is a fire ! Get out of there . Skaar didn ' t panic . She figured that it was just a small fire . Her office building was huge . There were 62 floors and her desk was on the 37thfloor . Skaar called out to office mate Stephen Oksas , who also stayed late to work . But when they got out to the hallway , they were met by a cloud of black smoke . Rushing back , Skaar shut the door and filled the space at the bottom of the door with her jacket to keep the smoke out . Then they called 911 . before they could call their families , however , the line went dead . That meant that they were completely cut off from the outside world . All they could do was wait and hope someone would come to rescue them . Minutes ticked by . Smoke began to float into the office . Soon it became hard for them to breathe . Looking around , Skaar noticed a small workroom . It seemed to have cleaner air . So they crowed there . That helped for a while , but in time even the workroom was filled with deadly smoke .

Your website is an electronic meeting place for your family , friends and potentially , millions of people around the world . Best of all , you may not have to spend a cent . The Web is filled with all kinds of free services and all it takes is some time and creativity . Think of your home page as the starting point of your website . Like the table of contents of a book or a magazine , the home page is the front door . Your site can have one or more pages , depending on how you design it . While web pages vary greatly in their design and content , most use a traditional magazine layout . At the top of the page is a banner GRAPHIC . Next comes a greeting and a short description of the site . Pictures , texts , and links to other websites follow . Before you start building your site , do some planning . Think about whom the site is for and what you want to say . Next , gather up the material that you want to put on the site . Draw a rough layout on a sheet of paper . While there are no rules you have to follow , there are a few things to keep in mind : Start simply . If you are too ambitious at the beginning , you may never get the site off the ground . You can always add to your site . Less is better . Most people don ' t like to read a lot of text online . Break it into small pieces . Smaller is better . Most people connect to the Internet with a modem . Since it can take a long time to download large image files , keep the file sizes small . Have the rights .

It consisted of a control unit with three other small units . I put the control unit in the sitting room and fastened the other units by the front door , back door and living - room windows . The instructions told us to choose three numbers , so we chose 491 , the last three numbers of our telephone number . Now I must explain how the alarm works : 1 . There is a power siren in the control unit . It makes a very loud noise . 2 . Each of the small units sends out beams or rays in different directions . If anything moves , it breaks a beam . This sends a signal to the control unit . The siren makes a noise that you can hear 50 meters away . 3 . When we go to bed , I press the three buttons numbered 4 , 9 and 1 . Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work . That might I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house . However , at about 2 : 10a . m . , I woke up and heard the siren . \" There must be a burglar in the house , \" Mary said . \" What shall we do ? \" \" I ' ll go and see who ' s there , \" I said . \" Stay here . Don ' t make a noise . \" I went downstairs quietly . When I reached the living room , I switched on my torch and looked round the room . Then I turned the light on . I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs . There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked . I locked it , re - set the alarm and went back to bed . About an hour later , the alarm started again . I jumped out of bed , fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door . Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch . \" Hey ! Wait a minute ! \" I whispered . \" It ' s only me . I ' m going downstairs to see what ' s wrong . \" I went down into the living room and listened for a moment . The only sound I could hear was the siren . I turned on the light and then switched the siren off . As I did so , I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows . I saw a house lizard disappear behind the curtains . \" Oh ! \" I said to myself . \" That ' s our burglar . \" When the lizard moved , it started the siren . I guessed that the alarm had been made in Europe , where there are no house lizards . Well , I won ' t finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge , let me know .
