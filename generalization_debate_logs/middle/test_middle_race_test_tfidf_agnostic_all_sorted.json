It makes wishes come true for children who have serious illnesses . It gives them hope and joy and helps them forget about their health problems and have fun . It all started in 1980 in Phoenix , Arizona . Christopher was a 7 - year - old boy who was very sick . He always dreamed of becoming a police officer . Tommy Austin and Ron Cox , two police officers , made his wish come true . They gave Cristopher a tour of the city in a police helicopter ( ) and made a real police uniform for him . There are four kinds of wishes children usually have : I wish to go . Children ueually want to travel or go to a concert , a game or a park . I wish to meet . Children sometimes want to meet their favourite actors , singers or players . I wish to be . Some children wish to become actors , singers or police officers . I wish to have .

She reached into her change purse , emptied out all the coins she had and gave them to the homeless man . Neither of them realized that this small generous act would change their lives . Sarah didn ' t realize that she had given Billy not only all her change but also her diamond ring that she had put in her change purse earlier until the following morning . She and her husband , Bill Krejci , rushed to see if they could find Billy . The homeless man was not only in the same place , he also immediately returned the ring . The grateful couple paid him back for his honesty by emptying out their pockets of all the money they had . Bill Krejci , a web designer , felt that he needed to do something more for this amazingly honest man . So on February 18th , he set up a special page to raise money for him .

The villagers asked him to leave , for they feared he wanted them to give him food . They told him that there was no food . The traveller explained that he didn ' t need any food and that , in fact , he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead . The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag , and dropped the stone into the pot of water . After a moment , he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement , \" How delicious the soup is ! \" As the villagers began to show interest , he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it . A villager brought out a cabbage to share . This episode repeated itself until the soup had cabbage , carrots , onions , and beets - - indeed , a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready . This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things . We do not want to share . The story of stone soup helps us realize that , in doing so , we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast . The meaning of this story goes far beyond food . We keep to ourselves ideas , love , and energy , thinking we will be richer , but in fact we make the world , and ourselves , poorer . The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back , and he had the ability to inspire them to give .

I have learned over the past years that sometimes when I lose , I get a lot more out of it than winning . Also , I find a lot of times in sports , people are getting too caught up in the game instead of just having fun . The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way . I greatly encourage you to be a part of the school sports . Even if you are not the best , you can still have fun . Sports give people a great and healthy way of spending an afternoon , instead of lying around playing video games or even getting into bad things . Sports also give us a sense of achievement . There isn ' t a better feeling than to have done something fun and productive for my day . I think that we all need sports to give us courage . If we try hard in sports , we usually do well . If we did the same in study , we would all be champions . Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it ' s just fun . Without sports , our lives would just be boring . So as you may be able to tell , sports are amazing ! Our coaches not only teach us to play sports , but show class and good sportsmanship while playing them . It ' s never fun when you lose to have the competitor rub it in your face . That ' s why our coaches teach us to show class when we lose ; also , when coaches _ , don ' t get down .

Also , I find a lot of times in sports , people are getting too caught up in the game instead of just having fun . The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way . I greatly encourage you to be a part of the school sports . Even if you are not the best , you can still have fun . Sports give people a great and healthy way of spending an afternoon , instead of lying around playing video games or even getting into bad things . Sports also give us a sense of achievement . There isn ' t a better feeling than to have done something fun and productive for my day . I think that we all need sports to give us courage . If we try hard in sports , we usually do well . If we did the same in study , we would all be champions . Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it ' s just fun . Without sports , our lives would just be boring . So as you may be able to tell , sports are amazing ! Our coaches not only teach us to play sports , but show class and good sportsmanship while playing them . It ' s never fun when you lose to have the competitor rub it in your face . That ' s why our coaches teach us to show class when we lose ; also , when coaches _ , don ' t get down .

Besides close friends , your peers include other children you know who are the same age - - - - - - like people in your grade , sports team , or neighborhood . Peers may have a positive influence on each other and play important roles in each other ' s lives : Positive examples Peers set plenty of good examples for each other . Having peers who do well in school or do their best in a sport can influence you to work hard to realize your dream , too . Peers who are kind and helpful can influence you to build these qualities in yourself . Even peers you ' ve never met can be role models . For example , watching someone your age compete in the Olympics or give a piano concert might inspire you to go after a dream of your own . Feedback and advice Your peers listen and give you feedback as you try out new ideas . They can help you make decisions , too : what courses to take , whether to get your hair cut or let it grow , or how to solve a problem . Peers often give each other good advice . Your peers will be quick to tell you when they think you ' re making a mistake or doing something dangerous .

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends . Playing music enriches life . The question is : Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination ? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school ? The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes - - if we change the way music is taught . Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150 , 000 children . The organization has given 30 , 000 free instruments out , mainly guitars , and trained 1 , 500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs , performing in bands , and writing their own music . The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it - - not by notation , but by listening , imitation and meaningful experimentation . \" The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited , \" explains Dave Wish , the founder of Little Kids Rock . \" In high school , my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever . On the first day of class , Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs . The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running . Their progress is surprising . Within a year , eight and nine - year - olds are playing musical instruments , and giving concerts , even performing their own songs .

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \" train - spotter \" in Britain is related to \" geek \" or \" nerd \" ( someone who seems very ridiculous ) . But is this reputation really deserved ? First of all , let ' s see what train - spotting is . It is said that there are some 100 , 000 train spotters in the UK . Exactly as the title suggests , they spot trains , that is , they stand in train stations , look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down . The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country . Being crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804 . As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster , so did the interest in them grow ? Is this any stranger than people who love cars ? So , what do you need to be a train - spotter ? Well , all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers . Other equipment includes hot tea in a thermos , a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don ' t want to risk the delights of railway station food . It ' s interesting to note that despite the \" bad name \" of train - spotting , there have been famous railway lovers in history , such as Alfred Hitchcock , who filmed them regularly , especially The 39 Steps . There is evidence , too , that being a train - spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain .

Some people also feel it safe to follow a large number of people . In some _ cases it might be right to follow the crowd , but in most cases this can be one big mistake . Ninety - five percent of people never succeed because they are following the wrong group . Actually there are reasons why we shouldn ' t follow the crowd blindly . According to a study , people tend to follow the crowd when they aren ' t sure about the direction they should take . This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what ' s right and what ' s wrong ! This attracts more people to follow them and the result is that most people move in a certain direction even if it isn ' t right . A man who wants to be successful always hopes for others ' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people , but the question this man never asks himself is : are all of those people successful ? Of course not ! If you want to follow a crowd , then follow a successful one . However , in real life you ' ll only find one successful person among hundreds of people , and that ' s why following the crowd makes no sense at all . Most people act without thinking wisely .

Some people also feel it safe to follow a large number of people . In some _ cases it might be right to follow the crowd , but in most cases this can be one big mistake . Ninety - five percent of people never succeed because they are following the wrong group . Actually there are reasons why we shouldn ' t follow the crowd blindly . According to a study , people tend to follow the crowd when they aren ' t sure about the direction they should take . This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what ' s right and what ' s wrong ! This attracts more people to follow them and the result is that most people move in a certain direction even if it isn ' t right . A man who wants to be successful always hopes for others ' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people , but the question this man never asks himself is : are all of those people successful ? Of course not ! If you want to follow a crowd , then follow a successful one .

As a quiet child , Rachel liked to read and write stories . At a very early age , she decided she wanted to be a writer some day . Her story first appeared in a children ' s magazine when she was ten years old . Her first books , Under the Sea Wind came out in 1941 . In 1948 , Miss Carson began working on another book , The Sea Around Us . She always remembered carefully when she wrote . She collected information from more than one thousand places to write The Sea Around Us . When the book came out in 1951 , it won the National Book Award . It was No . 1 on the best - seller list for more than a year . The Sea Around Us made Rachel Carson famous . Rachel Carson ' s most famous book , Silent Spring came out in 1962 .

Scientists think that there are also two kinds of people : people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours . The warm colours are red , orange and yellow . Where there are warm colours and a lot of lights , people usually want to be active . People think that red , for example , is exciting . Sociable people , those who like to be with others , like red . Scientists also find that warm colours can produce a comfortable feeling and that time seems to pass quickly in a room with warm colours than with cool colours .

Sometimes a writer puts ideas together by asking questions and then answering them . For example , if the article is about groundhogs , the set of questions in the writer ' s head might be : What does a groundhog look like ? Where do groundhogs live ? What do they eat ? . . . In the article , the author might answer those questions . Sometimes an author writes out her questions in the article . These questions give you signals . They tell you what the author is going to write next . Often an author has a question in her head but she doesn ' t write it out for you . You have to work out her question for yourself . Here ' s a sample reading for you to practice this method . Earthworms Do you know how many kinds of earthworms there are ? There are about 1800 kinds in the world ! They can be brown , purple , green . They can be as small as 3 cm long and as large as 3 m long . The best time to see earthworms is at night , especially a cool , damp night . That ' s when they come up from their burrows to hunt for food . Earthworms don ' t like to be in the sun . That ' s because they breathe through their skin , and they can ' t breathe if their skin gets too dry . Earthworms must come out of the earth if it rains a lot , because they can ' t breathe in their flooded burrows . What a dangerous life ! Earthworms don ' t have eyes , so how can they tell when it ' s dark ? They have special places on their skin that are sensitive to light . These spots tell whether it ' s light or dark . If you shine a flashlight on an earthworm at night , it will quickly disappear into the ground . Earthworms don ' t have ears either , but they can hear by feeling movements in the earth . If you want to hear like an earthworm , lie on the ground with your fingers in your ears . Then have a friend stamp his or her feet near you . This is how earthworms feel birds and people walking , and moles digging , near them . Earthworms are useful . Farmers and gardeners like having lots of earthworms in their land because the worms help to make better soil when they dig . That digging keeps the soil loose and airy .
