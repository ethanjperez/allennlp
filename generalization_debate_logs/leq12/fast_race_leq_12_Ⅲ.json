Baron Pierre de Coubertin , who gave new life to the Games , was very much a man of his time . He didn ' t like women showing up for the Games . But since this time , things have changed . History shows that the number of women participating in the Olympic Games has been increasing over the years , since their first participation in the 1900 Olympic Games and especially in the last 30 years . This development is of social , political and cultural significance . The progress is the result of the cooperation of the entire Olympic Movement and of proper measures that the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , International Sports Federations ( IFs ) , and National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) have taken . Especially in the last 20 years , the IOC has enlarged the women ' s programme at the Olympic Games , in cooperation with IFs and the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games ( OCOGs ) . This development was further strengthened by the IOC ' s decision that all sports must have women ' s events . The IOC also started to work on increasing the number of women at leadership level in sport in 1981 .

The seven are Peking University , Beihang University , Beijing Normal University , Nankai University , Fudan University , Xiamen University and Hong Kong University . Students who want to gain entrance to any of the seven universities will only have to sit one independent exam , according to the joint announcement . \" This will help lighten the students ' load , otherwise they must take several exams for different universities , \" said the announcement . Passing the exam could result in more than one interview chance , giving the students more opportunities to choose their favorite universities . China ' s college entrance exam system is undergoing reform as universities aim to select students based on independent criteria rather than just using the results of the national exam . In 2003 , Peking University and another 21 universities were allowed to pilot the reform by using their own criteria to independently select five percent of their students . Now nearly 80 universities across the country have the right to select talented students based on their own exams .

If people go \" Dutch treat \" , or simply \" go Dutch \" , it means that they will share the expenses of a social engagement . There are many other \" Dutch \" expressions in English , many of which were invented in Britain in the seventeenth century , when the Dutch and the English were commercial and military rivals . The British used \" Dutch \" to refer to something bad , cheap and shameful . A \" Dutch bargain \" at that time was an uneven , one - sided deal ; \" Dutch reckoning \" was an unitemized account ; and \" Dutch widow \" was slang for prostitute . Later centuries brought in \" Dutch courage \" , for bravery caused by drink ; \" Dutch concert \" , for noisy music ; \" Dutch nightingale \" , meaning a frog ; and \" double Dutch \" , for incomprehensible language or talk .

At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting , where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely . They also elected the town ' s officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters . These meetings were usually held at the town hall , which was located in the central square . In the eighteenth - century town meetings , only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted , although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions .

Designed by researchers at Japan ' s Tsukuba University , the device supports the flex ( ) of the knee , which enables a runner to use 30 % less muscle power compared to running unassisted . Coming in a kit , the device consists of a small motor that helps flex the knee , a sensor that detects the knees ' degree of flex , and a safety lever - - all of which attach to the user ' s leg . The user is also forced to carry a backpack that holds a control unit and battery to power the motor . All up the device weighs around 5kg , which will probably lessen the performance benefits of wearing the device somewhat . In experiments runners wearing the device could jog at 7 . 5kmh , which is hardly anything special - - but predictably they could do it for longer . Curiously , the makers of the motorized knee say it isn ' t designed for the physically handicapped . Rather it is intended for people who want to run in a more efficient way .

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a group established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program , reports that the average surface temperature of the earth has increased during the twentieth century by 0 . 6deg _ 0 . 2degC . ( The _ 0 . 2degC means that the increase might be as small as 0 . 4degC or as great as 0 . 8degC ) . This may seem like a small shift , but although regional and short - - term temperatures do fluctuate over a wide range , global temperatures are generally quite stable . In fact , the difference between today ' s average global temperature and the average global temperature during the last Ice Age is only about 5 degrees C . Indeed , it ' s warmer today around the world than at any time during the past 1 , 000years , and the warmest years of the previous century have occurred within the past decade . We also know that human activities - - primarily the burning of fossil fuels - - have increased the greenhouse gas content of the earth ' s atmosphere significantly over the same period . Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases , which trap heat near the planet ' s surface . The vast majority of climate researchers agree with these overall findings . The scientific disagreements that do still exist primarily concern detailed aspects of the processes that make up these largely accepted general themes .

Alexander pointed out : wearing the right glasses as soon as possible is still the best way to cure and put right children ' s eyesight problems . In America and Japan the resinous glasses have taken up 80 percent of the glasses market . And some European countries and America have made it a law that children , teenagers and drivers must wear resinous glasses .

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so - called \" found photographs \" - - a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger ' s family album . The German artist Joachim Schmid , who believes \" basically everything is worth looking at \" , has gathered discarded photographs , postcards and newspaper images since 1982 . In his on - going project , Archiv , he groups photographs of family life according to themes : people with dogs ; teams ; new cars ; dinner with the family ; and so on . Like Schmid , the editors of several self - published art magazines also champion found photographs . One of them , called simply Found , was born one snowy night in Chicago , when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for someone else : \" Why ' s your car HERE at HER place ? \" The note became the starting point for Rothbard ' s addictive publication , which features found photographs sent in by readers , such as a poster discovered in your drawer . The whole found - photograph phenomenon has raised some questions . Perhaps one of the most difficult is : can these images really be considered as art ? And , if so , whose art ? Yet found photographs produced by artists , such as Richard Prince , may raise endless possibilities . What was the cowboy in Prince ' s Untitled doing ? Was he riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone ? Or how did Prince create this photograph ? It ' s anyone ' s guess . In addition , as we imagine the back - story to the people in the found photographs artists , like Schmid , have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums .

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so - called \" found photographs \" - - a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger ' s family album . The German artist Joachim Schmid , who believes \" basically everything is worth looking at \" , has gathered discarded photographs , postcards and newspaper images since 1982 . In his on - going project , Archiv , he groups photographs of family life according to themes : people with dogs ; teams ; new cars ; dinner with the family ; and so on . Like Schmid , the editors of several self - published art magazines also champion found photographs . One of them , called simply Found , was born one snowy night in Chicago , when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for someone else : \" Why ' s your car HERE at HER place ? \" The note became the starting point for Rothbard ' s addictive publication , which features found photographs sent in by readers , such as a poster discovered in your drawer . The whole found - photograph phenomenon has raised some questions . Perhaps one of the most difficult is : can these images really be considered as art ? And , if so , whose art ? Yet found photographs produced by artists , such as Richard Prince , may raise endless possibilities . What was the cowboy in Prince ' s Untitled doing ? Was he riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone ? Or how did Prince create this photograph ? It ' s anyone ' s guess . In addition , as we imagine the back - story to the people in the found photographs artists , like Schmid , have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums . Why is memory so important to us ? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children , our parents , our lovers , and ourselves ? Will they mean anything to anyone after we ' ve gone ?

But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants - - - or even use it for laundry , dishes , or other needs - - - collecting rainwater from your gutter ' s downspouts is a _ According to John C . Davis , writing in E / The Environmental Magazine , just about any homeowner can collect rainwater , given that the roof and gutters do most of the work . And since an inch of rain falling on a 2 , 000 - square - foot roof produces some 1 , 200 gallons of water , you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden . Plants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water , which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth . Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes , since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes . However , homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs . Rainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community , as it reduces the erosion , flooding , and pollution associated with heavy rainfall , and reduces dependence on public water supplies . So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities . Many varieties of rain barrel systems , starting at just $ 100 , are available for home use . A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter ' s downspout . Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems , but buying one is a lot easier .
