This repo contains the code for training ML agents to find evidence in a passage for various answers to a question.
You can find our EMNLP paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05863).

## Code Overview

Our code was forked from AllenNLP ([Jan 18, 2019 commit](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/tree/11d8327890bf3665fe687b1284f280a2a3974931)).

## Key arguments

In the code, we refer to the Judge Model as "judge" and Evidence Agents as "debaters," following [Irving et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899).
All trained models trained with the `allennlp train` command use a BERT architecture.
We use the `--debate-mode` flag to indicate what answer an evidence agent aims to support (during training or inference).
We represent each turn as a single character:
<table>
<tr>
    <td><b> Search Agent </b></td>
    <td><b> Learned Agent </b></td>
    <td><b> Evidence Found </b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> Ⅰ </td>
    <td> ⅰ </td>
    <td> For option 1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> Ⅱ </td>
    <td> ⅱ </td>
    <td> For option 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> Ⅲ </td>
    <td> ⅲ </td>
    <td> For option 3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> Ⅳ </td>
    <td> ⅳ </td>
    <td> For option 4 (RACE-only) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> E </td>
    <td> e </td>
    <td> For Every answer option per question </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> L </td>
    <td> l </td>
    <td> For one random answer per question ("Lawyer" - worse than "e" which ensures we train with every answer option) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> W </td>
    <td> w </td>
    <td> For one random Wrong answer per question </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> A </td>
    <td> a </td>
    <td> For the correct answer ("Alice") </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> B </td>
    <td> b </td>
    <td> Against the correct answer ("Bob") </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> N/A </td>
    <td> f </td>
    <td> Trains a Judge Model via supervised learning </td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that "ⅰ/Ⅰ," "ⅱ/Ⅱ," "ⅲ/Ⅲ," and "ⅳ/Ⅳ," are each one *roman numeral character*; when using these options, just copy and paste the appropriate characters rather than typing "i/I", "ii/II," "iii/III", or "iv/IV."
For our final results, we did not use options "l/L," "w/W," "a/A," or "b/B," but they are implemented and may be useful for others.

To have evidence agents take multiple turns, simply use one character per turn, stringing them together with spaces (when turns are sequential) or without spaces (when turns are simultaneous).
For example, `--debate-mode ⅰⅱ ⅢⅣ` first will have learned agents supporting options 1 and 2 choose a sentence each (simultaneously) and then will have search agents supporting options 3 and 4 choose a sentence each (simultaneously).

## Installation

#### Setting up a virtual environment

[Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment (Python 3.6 or 3.7):

1.  [Download and install Conda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html).

2.  Create a Conda environment with Python 3.6

    ```bash
    conda create -n convince python=3.6
    ```

3.  Activate the Conda environment

    ```bash
    conda activate convince
    ```

#### Installing the library and dependencies

Clone this repo and move to `convince/allennlp/` (where all commands should be run from):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethanjperez/convince.git
   cd convince/allennlp
   ```

Install dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install --editable .
   ```

## Downloading Data

From the base directory (`convince/allennlp/`), make a folder to store datasets:

   ```bash
   mkdir datasets
   ```

Download RACE using the Google form linked on [this page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~glai1/data/race/).
You'll immediately receive an email with a link to the dataset, which you can download with:

   ```bash
   wget [link]
   tar -xvzf RACE.tar.gz
   mv RACE datasets/race_raw
   rm RACE.tar.gz
   ```

Here are the RACE dataset subsets we used for [short](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NtHubMpsz9CUy5_0ZMXdoU6jbJ2BHR18) and [long](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hjgs6XMWcSh8AAReLFbaaOy0SBHhw2dQ) passages (place these in `datasets/`).
To download Google Drive files via command line, add the following function definition to your bash profile (i.e., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
```bash
    function gdrive_download () {
      CONFIRM=$(wget --quiet --save-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --no-check-certificate "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=$1" -O- | sed -rn 's/.*confirm=([0-9A-Za-z_]+).*/\1\n/p')
      wget --load-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=$CONFIRM&id=$1" -O $2
      rm -rf /tmp/cookies.txt
    }
```
Then, open a new terminal (or use e.g. `source ~/.bashrc`) and download via the file ID of the Google Drive links above:
    ```bash
    gdrive_download 1NtHubMpsz9CUy5_0ZMXdoU6jbJ2BHR18 num_sents_leq_12.zip
    unzip num_sents_leq_12.zip
    mv num_sents_leq_12 datasets/num_sents_leq_12
    rm num_sents_leq_12.zip
    
    gdrive_download 1Hjgs6XMWcSh8AAReLFbaaOy0SBHhw2dQ num_sents_gt_26.zip
    unzip num_sents_gt_26.zip
    mv num_sents_gt_26 datasets/num_sents_gt_26
    rm num_sents_gt_26.zip
    ```
 
You can split RACE into middle (`race_raw_middle`) and high school (`race_raw_high`) subsets via:
   ```bash
   cp -r datasets/race_raw datasets/race_raw_high
   rm -r datasets/race_raw_high/*/middle
   cp -r datasets/race_raw datasets/race_raw_middle
   rm -r datasets/race_raw_middle/*/high
   ```

Download DREAM:

   ```bash
   mkdir datasets/dream
   for SPLIT in train dev test; do
     wget https://github.com/nlpdata/dream/blob/master/data/$SPLIT.json -O datasets/dream/$SPLIT.json
   done
   ```

Here is the long passage DREAM subset we used for [dev](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15c1B0LRv_RMrtmycrYV1T8zK_n0jlkES) and [test](https://drive.google.com/open?id=174l4d_oz5Qjyp0W8zUUK6JRxgdGqDIlf) (place these in `datasets/dream`). You can download these via command line:
    ```bash
    gdrive_download 15c1B0LRv_RMrtmycrYV1T8zK_n0jlkES datasets/dream/dev.num_sents_gt_26.json
    gdrive_download 174l4d_oz5Qjyp0W8zUUK6JRxgdGqDIlf datasets/dream/test.num_sents_gt_26.json
    ```

Download BERT:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p datasets/bert
   cd datasets/bert
   
   # Download and unzip BERT Base
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip
   unzip uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip
   
   # [Optional] Download and unzip BERT Large
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip
   unzip uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip
   
   cd ../..
   ```

## Training a BERT Judge Model

The below command gave us a BERT Base QA model (available ) with 66.32% dev accuracy at epoch 5:

   ```bash
   allennlp train training_config/race.best.jsonnet --serialization-dir tmp/race.best.f --debate-mode f --accumulation-steps 32
   ```

You can download this model from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ymA_MziGDYonY3Ck6Wbhss7lSD7AtzX0) (unzip it and place in `tmp/`) or via command line:
   ```bash
   gdrive_download 1ymA_MziGDYonY3Ck6Wbhss7lSD7AtzX0 race.best.f.zip
   unzip race.best.f.zip
   mv race.best.f.zip tmp/
   rm race.best.f.zip
   ```

To train a BERT Large Judge (we needed a GPU with 32GB of memory):
   ```bash
   allennlp train training_config/race.large.best.jsonnet --serialization-dir tmp/race.large.best.f --debate-mode f --accumulation-steps 12
   ```

## Using Search Agents

The below command will load the judge model as part of an evidence agent (with dummy weights). The agent tries each possible sentence to choose a sentence:
   ```bash
   DM=Ⅰ  # Replace with Ⅱ Ⅲ Ⅳ to get evidence for other answers
   allennlp train training_config/race.best.jsonnet --serialization-dir tmp/race.best.f.dm=$DM --judge-filename tmp/race.best.f/model.tar.gz --eval-mode --debate-mode $DM --search-outputs-path tmp/race.best.f.dm=$DM/search_outputs.pkl
   ```

The above command will pretty print the single best search-chosen evidence for the first answer option in every RACE validation example.
The results will be saved to a json file starting with `debate_log` in the serialization directory `tmp/race.best.f.dm=$DM`.
You can also change the evaluation dataset by copying `training_config/race.best.jsonnet` into a new config file and changing `validation_data_path: datasets/race_raw/dev` to `validation_data_path: datasets/race_raw/test`.
You can change the training dataset in a similar way; if you're just running inference/evaluation (as you are for search agents), you can save the time to load RACE's training set by changing `train_data_path: datasets/race_raw/train` to `train_data_path: allennlp/tests/fixtures/data/race_raw/train` (tiny slice of the dataset).

To show a more complicated example, here's how you can run round-robin evidence selections with multiple turns (6 per agent):
   ```bash
   for DM in ⅠⅡ ⅠⅢ ⅠⅣ ⅡⅢ ⅡⅣ ⅢⅣ; do
     allennlp train training_config/race.best.jsonnet --serialization-dir tmp/race.best.f.dm=${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM} --judge-filename tmp/race.best.f/model.tar.gz --eval-mode --debate-mode $DM $DM $DM $DM $DM $DM --search-outputs-path tmp/race.best.f.dm=${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM}_${DM}/search_outputs.pkl
   done
   ```

## Training Learned Agents

With the below commands, you can train a learned agent to predict the search-chosen sentence:
   ```bash
   # Learn to predict search-chosen sentence
   # We got 56.8% accuracy at Epoch 6
   allennlp train training_config/race.best.debate.sl.lr=5e-6.jsonnet --judge-filename tmp/race.best.f/model.tar.gz --debate-mode e --search-outputs-path tmp/race.best.f/search_outputs.pkl --accumulation-steps 12 --reward-method sl --serialization-dir tmp/race.e.c=concat.bsz=12.lr=5e-6.m=sl

   # Learn to predict the Judge Model's probability given each sentence
   # We got 55.1% accuracy at predicting the search-chosen sentence at Epoch 5
   allennlp train training_config/race.best.debate.sl.lr=1e-5.jsonnet --judge-filename tmp/race.best.f/model.tar.gz --debate-mode e --search-outputs-path tmp/race.best.f/search_outputs.pkl --accumulation-steps 12 --reward-method sl-sents --serialization-dir tmp/race.e.c=concat.bsz=12.lr=1e-5.m=sl-sents

   # Learn to predict the Judge Model's change in probability given each sentence
   # We got 54.3% accuracy at predicting the search-chosen sentence at Epoch 4
   allennlp train training_config/race.best.debate.sl.lr=1e-5.jsonnet --judge-filename tmp/race.best.f/model.tar.gz --debate-mode e --search-outputs-path tmp/race.best.f/search_outputs.pkl --accumulation-steps 12 --reward-method sl-sents --influence --serialization-dir tmp/race.e.c=concat.bsz=12.lr=1e-5.m=sl-sents.i
   ```

Training to convergence takes roughly 1 week on a v100 (16GB).
During the first epoch, we run a search agent to find the judge predictions given each sentence.
We then cache the judge predictions to the file specified after `--search-outputs-path`.
The cached predictions are used throughout the rest of the training (i.e., epochs after the first are faster).
If you've already train a supervised model, you can save time by training other models simply using the cached predictions from training that model (as in the commands above).  

## Implementation Notes

- The code also support the following training options that we don't use in the paper, most notably: 
    - *Reinforcement Learning* to train evidence agents. You can train agents to maximize the Judge's probability on an agent's answer by setting `--reward-method prob`. RL agents could learn to convince the Judge of correct answers (~70% of the time vs. ~80% for supervised learning agents). However, we couldn't really get RL agents to learn to convince the Judge of incorrect answers (RL agents performed marginally better than random sentence selection).
    - `--qa-loss-weight W`: Give agents an auxiliary supervised, question-answering loss with weight W. W=1 just adds the extra QA loss to the loss for predicting the Judge's behavior. In our experiments, this option did not clearly improve agents' ability to convince the Judge.
    - `--theory-of-mind`: Have agents use the Judge's activations (after the Judge reads the passage) as an auxiliary input. In our experiments, this option did not clearly improve agents' ability to convince the Judge.
- Make a new training_config file to change the pre-trained weights, training or validation data, or training hyperparameters. It's easiest to modify an existing config (i.e., `training_config/race.best.jsonnet`).
    - *Increase batch_size* for faster training if you have more GPU memory. Decrease the value for --accumulation-steps by the same factor (to maintain the same effective training batch size).
    - *Avoid loading the training set* to save time while debugging or only running inference/validation. To do so, replace `train_data_path: datasets/race_raw/train` to `train_data_path: allennlp/tests/fixtures/data/race_raw/train` (a tiny slice of the dataset). If debugging, you can also replace `validation_data_path: datasets/race_raw/train` to `validation_data_path: allennlp/tests/fixtures/data/race_raw/train` to save time and to check that you can overfit the training set.
