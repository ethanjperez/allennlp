Up till now , disabled children and those with learning difficulties were sent to special schools . They grew up in a different world . M : What made you decide to start this new school ? W : We realized that disabled children had no knowledge of children in ordinary schools . We thought it was important that all human beings should grow up together . M : Do the slower learners hold up the faster learners ? W : No . For some classes , slow learners and faster learners are separated . In other classes they all work together .

One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters . Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies , we seldom had a chance to get together as a family . But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week . First we tried setting fixed days : Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . But almost everyone was unhappy . Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot . We made plans for trips . We discussed each other 's problems . After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful . And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before .",

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot .

That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest .

But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week . First we tried setting fixed days : Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . But almost everyone was unhappy . Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot . We made plans for trips . We discussed each other 's problems . After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful .

Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest .

For today 's program , Mr. John Smith , chairman of National Weight and Health Association , has come with findings from out recent NWHA survey on obesity . Now , Mr. Smith , what is the purpose of your survey ? M : We wanted to explore how people around the world view obesity or being overweight . Actually , obesity has gone global . W : How did you do it ? M : We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries . W : How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates ? M : 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5 . W : Really surprising , is n't it ? And what are your findings about people 's attitudes regarding obesity ? M : Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin . 83 % of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight . French are most likely to blame Americans . They use American 's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem . Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity . They are followed by Germans and Indians . When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight , the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor . W : Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey , we will be back soon after the break .",

There is so much happening in everybody 's life . That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that . Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest . Also because people will sit down and say \" oh , here are my goals \" and forget all about them . Revisiting them every week is a good way .

There is so much happening in everybody 's life . That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that . Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest . Also because people will sit down and say \" oh , here are my goals \" and forget all about them . Revisiting them every week is a good way . They stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them .",

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

Now , Mr. Smith , what is the purpose of your survey ? M : We wanted to explore how people around the world view obesity or being overweight . Actually , obesity has gone global . W : How did you do it ? M : We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries . W : How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates ? M : 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5 . W : Really surprising , is n't it ? And what are your findings about people 's attitudes regarding obesity ? M : Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin . 83 % of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight . French are most likely to blame Americans . They use American 's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem . Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity . They are followed by Germans and Indians .

We really enjoy eating and it goes slow . Last winter , a friend from Portugal went to Belgium with me . For Christmas dinner , we met at 5:30 and then we started with some drinks . I think we ate from 6 o'clock in the afternoon till 12 o'clock that night . W : Wow ! You must be fat there if you eat that much . M : In fact we do n't .

It 's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night . Jason : What was the weather like ?

No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time , and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid . Jason : That 's really nice . Berry : The first day we had very nice weather , and were able to really relax on the beach . After these two days we had bad weather , rain and cloudy . So , we 're a little bit disappointed about that . Due to the weather , we explored the old part of Rio . Jason : How about the food there ? Berry : We ate at local restaurant . Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $ 10 . Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat . Dessert and drinks are not included .

But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

What would you like to know ? W : First of all , how was the standard weight used ? M : Well , the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country . The department of weights and measures , we are a government agency . It 's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales . W : How did you check the scales before ? M : We have an old standard weight that we used to use . It had to be replaced because it was imprecise . You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous . It absorbed too much moisture . W : Oh . So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less . M : Exactly . And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country . So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal . W : How much did it cost ? M : About 45 thousand dollars . W : 45 000 dollars ? For one kilogram weight ? That 's more expensive than gold . Is it really worth that much ? M : I 'm sure it is . Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard . Think of the drug industry , for example , those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine .",

Here it was a lot of fat middle - aged Europeans and Americans exercising along the beach , sunbathing , walking with their walkmans . It 's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night . Jason : What was the weather like ? Berry : The climate is very different from other places such as Peru or Bolivia . We were at sea level , and we all felt very good about it . No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time , and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid . Jason : That 's really nice . Berry : The first day we had very nice weather , and were able to really relax on the beach . After these two days we had bad weather , rain and cloudy . So , we 're a little bit disappointed about that . Due to the weather , we explored the old part of Rio . Jason : How about the food there ? Berry : We ate at local restaurant . Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $ 10 . Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat . Dessert and drinks are not included . Jason : It 's been really a nice trip . Berry : Well , Rio was not the experience we had hoped for , and we feel that this city is over - publicized . But anyway it 's cool to have been there .",

And of course when you go out , you 'll wrap up warm . But inside in the houses it 's always very warm , much warmer than at home . Swedish people always complain that when they visit England , the houses are cold even in the good winter . W : And what about the darkness ? M : Well , yeah , around Christmas time there 's only one hour of daylight , so you really looks forward to the spring . It is sometimes a bit depressing . But you see the summers are amazing , from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets . It 's still light in the midnight . You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper . W : Oh , yeah , the land of the midnight sun . M : Yeah , that 's right , but it 's wonderful . You wo n't stay up all night . And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon , so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings .

W : Well , actually , it was about the evolution of sea life -- a continuation from last week . The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells . They survived by shedding their shells -- somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago . M : That 's a pretty long span of time . W : I know . That 's what she said , though . To be precise : \" Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained . \" M : Some squid are really huge . Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ? M : Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters . W : Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that have n't been found because squid are intelligent and fast --- so they can easily get away from humans .

Is it if the railways happen being nationalized , they would simply have disappeared ? M : Oh , I think they would have . They 're disappearing fast in America .

Good evening ! W : What would you like to talk about the great writer ? Maybe some details that we do n't quite know . M : OK , Mark Twain , who traveled quite a lot , often because circumstances , usually financial circumstances forced him to . He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835 , and moved to Hannibal , Missouri with his family when he was about four years old . Most people think he was born in Hannibal , but that is n't true . W : Yes , I did n't know it if you do n't tell us this evening . M : Well , after his father died when he was about twelve , Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money . He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers , and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi . W : Did Twain like that job ? M : He loved this job , and many of his books show it . The river job did n't last however , because of the outbreak of the Civil War . To avoid joining the army , he went west - California . Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe . Twain did n't travel much the last ten years of his life , and he did n't publish much either . Somehow his travel inspired his writings .

They survived by shedding their shells -- somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago . M : That 's a pretty long span of time . W : I know . That 's what she said , though . To be precise : \" Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained . \" M : Some squid are really huge . Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ?

W : 45 000 dollars ? For one kilogram weight ? That 's more expensive than gold . Is it really worth that much ? M : I 'm sure it is .

Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe .

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

In fact , it can be flavored with tomato , cheese , or chocolate for instance M : How can it not taste fishy ? Do you know how this snack food is made ? W : First the fish is minced and cooked and fermented . Then water and starch are added to make a dough . M : It sounds awful .

Then we 'll meet on campus three times for reviews and exams . M : It sounds pretty non - traditional to me . But I guess it makes sense , considering how many students have jobs . It must really help with their schedules , not to mention how it will cut down on traffic . W : You know , last year my department did a survey and they found out that 80 percent of all psychology majors were employed . That 's why they came up with the program . M : The only thing is : does n't it seem impersonal though ? I mean , I miss having class discussions and hearing what other people thinks .

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

M : We 're getting ready for our entire staff to return early from vacation tomorrow whereupon we are going to move into temporary classrooms . And the other buildings that did not burn are being de - smoked . As to the cause of the fire , all we know is that we were having trouble with the pilot lights since we bought the stove in July and it had been serviced three times . Well , as a matter of fact , we think it was a malfunctioning stove that may have caused the fire . Nothing definite yet has been determined . W : Have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem ? M : No . I would n't know anything more about the stove itself . All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there 's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly . And it may be that there was a gas blast . But , again , this has not been determined officially by anybody . W : I got you . When do kids come back to school ? M : Next Monday , and we will be ready for them . Monday January 4 . We 're just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that 's because of the fire fighters that were here , nine of them . They 're wonderful . W : And I 'm sure you send your thanks out to them , uh ? M : Well , we 're sending out thanks to them in a letter or in any other way we can .

Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "W : Hello , Freddie . M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How 's everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

Gavin : A couple of weeks ago , and it 's an apartment actually . I was told by the landlord that it would be a good idea to get some insurance for the furniture and other personal possessions . Diane : Fine . Well , let 's get some details . What kind of apartment is it ? Gavin : It 's a two - bedroom apartment . Diane : What floor is it on ? Gavin : Why do you need to know that ? Diane : Because it affects the cost of the insurance . An apartment on the ground floor is n't as protected as others and there 's more chance of a break - in . Gavin : Really ? I did n't know that . It 's on the third , no ... second floor . Diane : Second ... and how much is the rent ? Gavin : It 's $ 615 per month . Diane : Good , and where is it located ? Gavin : In Biggins St. South Hill . Diane : I see . And what things did you want to insure ? Gavin : Well , what do you recommend ? Diane : Well , the most important things are those , which you would normally find in a home , things like the television , fridge and so on . Gavin : I see . Well , I 've got a fridge and a stereo system , which I 've just bought from a friend . Diane : And how much did you pay for the fridge ? Gavin : Err , $ 450 . Diane : 50 or 15 ? Gavin : 50 , and the stereo system costs $ 1,150 . Diane : Have you got a television ? Gavin : Yes , but it 's very old and not worth much . Diane : OK . Well , is there anything else you want to insure ? Gavin : Yes , I 've got a couple of watches and my CDs and books . Diane : How much do you think they 're worth ? Gavin : The watches are worth $ 1,000 ... Diane : For both of them ? Gavin : No . Each one and , all together , the CDs and books cost me about $ 400 . Diane : OK , so the value of everything you want to insure is $ 4,000 . Gavin : How much will the insurance cost ? Diane : Let me see , $ 4,000 divided by ... plus 10 % ... right , so this kind of insurance , err , that 's Private Contents insurance , it comes to $ 184.00 for a twelve - month period .

M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "W : Hello , Freddie . M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How 's everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

    "passage": "Program Host : Hi and welcome to our new show , Exotic Animal Kingdom , a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old . In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

    "passage": "W : Hello , Freddie . M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How 's everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",
