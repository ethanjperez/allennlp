    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",
