The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore 's climate change speeches around the world . It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already . This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this , and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together . I think it is a good film , but it is not perfect . The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time . I was watching this to find out about global warming , not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election . I imagine that these are the bits that teachers ' will have to skip when they show this to their classes , since they do n't really add anything to the film .

It is an excellent film for teachers to show their classes to explain global warming . It explains the facts very well , explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media , and is also pretty funny at times . The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore 's climate change speeches around the world . It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already . This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this , and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together . I think it is a good film , but it is not perfect . The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time . I was watching this to find out about global warming , not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election . I imagine that these are the bits that teachers ' will have to skip when they show this to their classes , since they do n't really add anything to the film .

This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this , and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together .

It is an excellent film for teachers to show their classes to explain global warming . It explains the facts very well , explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media , and is also pretty funny at times . The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore 's climate change speeches around the world . It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already . This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this , and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together . I think it is a good film , but it is not perfect . The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time . I was watching this to find out about global warming , not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election . I imagine that these are the bits that teachers ' will have to skip when they show this to their classes , since they do n't really add anything to the film .

Man : When I got my first job back in 1982 and started travelling , I had no other choice but eat out . I found that I felt different due to what I was eating , so I tried to find places that served food that made me feel good . The secret was the quality of the food and how well the food was prepared . I made an effort to find good restaurants as well as nice dishes . Woman : How did you manage to make a list of 218 favorite restaurants ? Man : I 've lived in many cities and when I moved back to Sweden from the United States , people asked me where to go and eat when they went to cities I knew . I got a lot of ideas . Then I wrote about restaurants for the Swedish club magazine and someone suggested I gather the information about the restaurants together since I had all the facts about the restaurants I 've been to . I started to do that . Woman : How do you find restaurants ? Man : The best way is to ask the people there . I may talk to the people at the street market or take a walk and look for a place for myself . I never asked a hotel clerk or a taxi driver .

You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically , but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one 's artistic quality . The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy . What do you want out of it ? What can you give ? Then of course there are tactics . How do you go about it ? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for ? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects . W : What do you mean by the behavioral aspects ? M : Well , that 's I think where the art comes in . In your behavior , you can either be an actor . You can pretend that you do n't like things which you are actually quite pleased about . Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without . Or you can be the honest type negotiator who 's known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight . But the artistic part of negotiation I think has to do with responding immediately to cues one gets in the process of negotiation . These can be verbal cues or even body language . This is where the artistic quality comes in . W : So really , you see two types of negotiator then , the actor or the honest one . M : That 's right . And both can work .

Because of improvements in medical science , people live longer than ever before . The birth rate has fallen .

Mr. Dong : I 'm a language teacher at the Jiaotong University in Shanghai . This university keeps up close relations with some British universities , among which is Oxford University . My university and Oxford have an exchange program . Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford ; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong . They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures , staying only a few weeks . The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month . It is all the money I have to cover all my expenses . Although I do not have much money , I 'm still happy that I have the opportunity to study in Britain . Being an English teacher in China , I , of course , do not have to pass the IELTS . Delia Robinson : Finally we want to introduce Mr. Yuan , who is financing his studies out of his own pocket . He wants to graduate in Oxford . Mr. Yuan : Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me . My parents paid me the flight from Beijing to London . In Britain I have relatives that came to Dover via Hong Kong about ten years ago . They give me 500 pounds each month . That is of course not enough to survive . So I get a part - time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month . I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University .

But remember the old people themselves are often against the idea of going to live with a young family . You see , modern houses and flats are very small ; much smaller than the sort of homes people used to live in . W : And when Granny gets very old , then the situation becomes even worse , does n't it ? M : Yes . As long as old people are able to look after themselves , the system works quite well . But as soon as they need any care and attention , the situation becomes very difficult indeed . It 's likely that old people may go into a nursing home , but it 's not as simple as that . Because of improvements in medical science , people live longer than ever before . The birth rate has fallen . This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention . The number of old people 's homes provided by the State is strictly limited . There are private nursing homes , but the cost is out of reach of the average family . W : And how do you see the situation developing in the future ? M : Well , obviously a lot of money is going to have to be spent . But it 's difficult persuading people to do this .

W : I am interested in the pattern of political involvement of women in those western democracies . With New Zealand and Australia leading the way , women in those countries had the vote soon after the end of World War I. M : It would be good to begin with a discussion of when women got the right to vote and how they use it . W : The record of women in politics in all those countries has been similar . None of them has women represented more than 10 percent of members of the national legislature . M : Remember , it is not what you think . You must back up your opinions with facts . Support for all your ideas is essential . I think you should check the statistics on what percentage of women hold political office in the national governments . W : Okay , I also plan to discuss the role of organized women 's rights . M : That is a good idea , but remember this term - paper is only 5,000 words so you must keep your topic focused .

My university and Oxford have an exchange program . Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford ; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong .

So I get a part - time job in a Chinese restaurant and earn about 400 or 500 pounds per month . I also had to pass the IELTS in order to study at a British University .

I 've personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean . We 've got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with . W : Say ? Hold on , Peter . I thought you said your organization was non - violent . What do you mean by \" harass \" ? M : Well , we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea . We talk to the men and try to change , you know , yell at them to stop . We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible .

    "passage": "Rental Car Agent : Hi . How can I help you ? Customer : Yeah . I 'd like to rent a mid - size car for three days . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Let me check to see if we have one available . Hmmm . It 's does n't look like we do . We have a couple of economy , compact , and full - size cars available , or a nice minivan . Customer : Well , what is the main difference between these cars ? Agent : The main difference is size . The economy car is the smallest , and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage . [ Okay . ] How many people are with you ? Customer : Just me and my son . Rental Car Agent : Well , the economy car would work . We have one right out front . Customer : Where ? That one ? It looks more like a shoebox to me . I 'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I do n't think so . Rental Car Agent : Well , if you need more room or comfort , I recommend the full - size car . It also has a nice stereo system , CD player , [ Alright ] safety rear door locks , and cruise control , and power locks and windows . Customer : Well , I 'm not so concerned about how it 's equipped . I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive . And what is the daily rate for that anyway ? Rental Car Agent : Well , let 's see here . Oh , yeah . It 'll come to fifty - seven ninety - five a day . Customer : Wow , a little expensive . But what 's the cost for mileage ? Rental Car Agent : Hey , all of our cars have unlimited miles , but of course , that does n't include gas . Customer : Yeah , right . I bet that car probably eats up gas , and now that were in the middle of the vacation season , gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices . Rental Car Agent : Well , as they say , it comes down to the law of supply an demand . Customer : Well , anyway , can you install a car seat in one of those cars ? I have a 3-year - old son with me . Rental Car Agent : Sure , and that 'll only be one dollar extra per day . Customer : I 'll go with the full - size car . Wait , uh ... what does it look like ? Rental Car Agent : Uh , it 's right out there in the parking lot . [ Which one ? ] The one over there next to the sidewalk . Customer : Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap ? Ahhh . Rental Car Agent : Sir , excuse me . We take pride in our vehicles . It 's just that it 's one of the last cars on our lot , but it runs like a dream . Do n't let the exterior fool you . Hey , I 'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers . Will there be any other drivers ? Customer : No , I 'm the only driver . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan ? Customer : What 's that exactly ? Rental Car Agent : Well , the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle , [ Okay ] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [ Oh ] . It even includes incidental road damage caused by , let 's say , a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car . [ Oh , uh , well ... ] . However , it wo n't cover loss of property due to theft . Too much crime in the area anyway . [ What ? Wh ... What about this crime ? What , what ? ] . Do n't worry about it . And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety - five per day . [ But you were saying ? ] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem . Customer : But would n't my own car insurance cover those problems ? Rental Car Agent : It might , but each insurance policy is different . With our car protection plan , however , you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [ Well ... ] , and we handle everything quickly , and you do n't have to contact your own insurance company . Okay . Let me just confirm this . A full - size car with a car seat for three days [ Yeah ] , plus the car protection package . Is that right ? [ That 's right . ] Okay , I 'll have our mechanic , Louie , check the car over and pull it up to the door . Customer : Push it up to the door ? I hope this car really runs . Rental Car Agent : Well , in case it does break down on some out - of - the - way , deserted road , just call the toll - free number for assistance . They 'll come to assist you within ... two business days . [ Two business days ! ! ! ] Enjoy your trip .",

He came home yesterday and said he 'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher , Miss Sanderson . She said he did n't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing , of course , and Michael was very embarrassed about it . Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress . W : She 's engaged at the moment , I 'm afraid . This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she 's going to be free soon ... W : I have a feeling she 's going to be busy all morning , Mr. Holloway . She 's at a Governors ' meeting . It could go on for a very long time ... M : Oh . Well , in that case , perhaps you could help me . W : Of course . What form is Michael in ? M : He 's a first year . He 's in 1B. His form teacher 's Mr. Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that 's the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that 's what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I 'm just looking at the information booklet , Mr. Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I 've got it in front of me . W : You 're looking at the top of Page 11 , are n't you ? M : That 's right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you 'll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it 's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings are n't repeated . M : So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque ... W : I 'm afraid so . M : Oh well . Anything for a quiet life , I suppose . Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit . W : Of course . Goodbye Mr. Holloway .",

    "passage": "Apartment Owner : Hello . Caller : Hi . I 'm calling about the ad for the apartment found in today 's newspaper . Apartment Owner : Okay . Caller : I 'm kind of desperate , and I need something right away . Apartment Owner : Okay . What would you like to know ? Caller : First of all , how big is it ? Apartment Owner : It 's a two - bedroom apartment with a living room , dining room and kitchen , and one bathroom . There 's also a place for a washer and dryer . Caller : Okay , and how old is the apartment complex ? Apartment Owner : Well , let 's just say it has a lot of history . To be honest , my great grandfather built it during the 1920s , but it 's a very sturdy and sound structure . Caller : Oh , and ... so , is the apartment furnished at all ? Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother 's old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother 's old dishwasher ? Okay . What 's the rent ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps . Does that include utilities ? Caller : Well , the rent includes gas and electricity , but not the phone bill . And the water pump is right out the back door . Caller : Water pump ! [ Yeah . ] Oh , yeah . Well , can I rent month - to - month , or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time ? Apartment Owner : We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment , and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period , hey ... you lose your deposit . Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 400 , and , of course , this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment , like the leaks in the old roof from last year 's snow storm . Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I did n't even know there was a rat 's nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That 's assuming that I even move in . Apartment Owner : Generally speaking , we return the deposit , minus a small fee for , you know , cleaning the apartment for the next tenant , but if you trash the place , then do n't expect to get anything back . Caller : Okay . Oh , um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It 's about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there 's a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it 's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there 's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you 'll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh ... I do n't know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there 's no guarantee it 'll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It 's one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah .... Are pets allowed ? Apartment Owner : Well , you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage , but we do n't allow larger animals like dogs , cats , or snakes . Things like that . Caller : Um , I have a rat ... Apartment Owner : You do n't have anything like that , do you ? Caller : Well , I have a rat that I keep in a cage . Will that be okay ? Apartment Owner : Well , as long it does n't escape , I guess that 's okay . Caller : And what 's your name ? Apartment Owner : It 's Norman . Norman Bates . Caller : Alright , Mr. Bates . I 'll see you tomorrow . Bye . Apartment Owner : Bye .",

Let me check to see if we have one available . Hmmm . It 's does n't look like we do . We have a couple of economy , compact , and full - size cars available , or a nice minivan . Customer : Well , what is the main difference between these cars ? Agent : The main difference is size . The economy car is the smallest , and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage . [ Okay . ] How many people are with you ? Customer : Just me and my son . Rental Car Agent : Well , the economy car would work . We have one right out front . Customer : Where ? That one ? It looks more like a shoebox to me . I 'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I do n't think so . Rental Car Agent : Well , if you need more room or comfort , I recommend the full - size car . It also has a nice stereo system , CD player , [ Alright ] safety rear door locks , and cruise control , and power locks and windows . Customer : Well , I 'm not so concerned about how it 's equipped . I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive . And what is the daily rate for that anyway ? Rental Car Agent : Well , let 's see here . Oh , yeah . It 'll come to fifty - seven ninety - five a day . Customer : Wow , a little expensive . But what 's the cost for mileage ? Rental Car Agent : Hey , all of our cars have unlimited miles , but of course , that does n't include gas . Customer : Yeah , right . I bet that car probably eats up gas , and now that were in the middle of the vacation season , gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices . Rental Car Agent : Well , as they say , it comes down to the law of supply an demand . Customer : Well , anyway , can you install a car seat in one of those cars ? I have a 3-year - old son with me . Rental Car Agent : Sure , and that 'll only be one dollar extra per day . Customer : I 'll go with the full - size car . Wait , uh ... what does it look like ? Rental Car Agent : Uh , it 's right out there in the parking lot . [ Which one ? ] The one over there next to the sidewalk . Customer : Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap ? Ahhh . Rental Car Agent : Sir , excuse me . We take pride in our vehicles . It 's just that it 's one of the last cars on our lot , but it runs like a dream . Do n't let the exterior fool you . Hey , I 'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers . Will there be any other drivers ? Customer : No , I 'm the only driver . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan ? Customer : What 's that exactly ? Rental Car Agent : Well , the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle , [ Okay ] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [ Oh ] . It even includes incidental road damage caused by , let 's say , a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car . [ Oh , uh , well ... ] . However , it wo n't cover loss of property due to theft . Too much crime in the area anyway . [ What ? Wh ... What about this crime ? What , what ? ] . Do n't worry about it . And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety - five per day . [ But you were saying ? ] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem . Customer : But would n't my own car insurance cover those problems ? Rental Car Agent : It might , but each insurance policy is different . With our car protection plan , however , you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [ Well ... ] , and we handle everything quickly , and you do n't have to contact your own insurance company . Okay . Let me just confirm this . A full - size car with a car seat for three days [ Yeah ] , plus the car protection package . Is that right ? [ That 's right . ] Okay , I 'll have our mechanic , Louie , check the car over and pull it up to the door . Customer : Push it up to the door ? I hope this car really runs . Rental Car Agent : Well , in case it does break down on some out - of - the - way , deserted road , just call the toll - free number for assistance .

Presenter : What about Research and Development ? Is n't that a separate department ? John Knox : Well , in terms of the laboratories , there are .. , there are two er ... one at each production plant . But it 's a department in the production division and it has a single head . And that 's Piet Van De Geer . Presenter : Are there any other features worth mentioning ? John Knox : Well , if we take our division , which of course I know best , we 've got several other departments , which all report , as I said , to Bill Williamson and which I am responsible for on this site . Er ... now there 's the ... , er ... , planning department . Ray Wood is in charge of that . And a purchasing department er ... they buy in the materials for production .

Apartment Owner : It 's a two - bedroom apartment with a living room , dining room and kitchen , and one bathroom . There 's also a place for a washer and dryer . Caller : Okay , and how old is the apartment complex ? Apartment Owner : Well , let 's just say it has a lot of history . To be honest , my great grandfather built it during the 1920s , but it 's a very sturdy and sound structure . Caller : Oh , and ... so , is the apartment furnished at all ? Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother 's old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother 's old dishwasher ? Okay . What 's the rent ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps . Does that include utilities ? Caller : Well , the rent includes gas and electricity , but not the phone bill . And the water pump is right out the back door . Caller : Water pump ! [ Yeah . ] Oh , yeah . Well , can I rent month - to - month , or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time ? Apartment Owner : We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment , and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period , hey ... you lose your deposit . Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 400 , and , of course , this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment , like the leaks in the old roof from last year 's snow storm . Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I did n't even know there was a rat 's nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That 's assuming that I even move in . Apartment Owner : Generally speaking , we return the deposit , minus a small fee for , you know , cleaning the apartment for the next tenant , but if you trash the place , then do n't expect to get anything back . Caller : Okay . Oh , um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It 's about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there 's a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it 's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there 's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you 'll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh ... I do n't know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there 's no guarantee it 'll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It 's one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah .... Are pets allowed ? Apartment Owner : Well , you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage , but we do n't allow larger animals like dogs , cats , or snakes . Things like that . Caller : Um , I have a rat ... Apartment Owner : You do n't have anything like that , do you ? Caller : Well , I have a rat that I keep in a cage . Will that be okay ?

This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she 's going to be free soon ... W : I have a feeling she 's going to be busy all morning , Mr. Holloway . She 's at a Governors ' meeting .

His form teacher 's Mr. Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that 's the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that 's what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I 'm just looking at the information booklet , Mr. Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I 've got it in front of me . W : You 're looking at the top of Page 11 , are n't you ? M : That 's right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you 'll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it 's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings are n't repeated .

You see , I 've been dating this woman , and well , I kind of told her that I 'm a pretty good runner , and uh ... Sales Associate : Well , how much , how much do you run ? 10Ks , marathons ? What exactly are you doing ? Customer : Well , I do n't really run . I mean I run out to get the newspaper in the morning . Listen , I twisted the truth a little . Sales Associate : Um , yeah , I 's say . Well , how much does she run ? Customer : Uh , she 's completed , I think , about 20 marathons , all under three hours . Sales Associate : Ah , man , you 're toast . You 're in some serious hot water . The only good new shoes will do for you is to kick yourself for not having been honest with her . Just fess up with her . Customer : Ah , ah , I think I have a leg cramp coming on . Believable ? Sales Associate : Forget it . She wo n't buy that story . Just be frank with her and apologize . She may or may not accept your apology , but at least you can look at yourself in the mirror and recognize that you told the truth . That way , you can live with yourself another day . Customer : Yeah . I realize that now . Sales Associate : Hey , here 's one idea . Tell her the truth and she what she says . If she forgives you and you really want to start running , then I suggest signing up for the 5 K race we are sponsoring next month . This can get you started on a new path to fitness and a positive relationship . Customer : And if she does n't forgive me ?

Caller : I 'm kind of desperate , and I need something right away . Apartment Owner : Okay . What would you like to know ? Caller : First of all , how big is it ? Apartment Owner : It 's a two - bedroom apartment with a living room , dining room and kitchen , and one bathroom . There 's also a place for a washer and dryer . Caller : Okay , and how old is the apartment complex ? Apartment Owner : Well , let 's just say it has a lot of history . To be honest , my great grandfather built it during the 1920s , but it 's a very sturdy and sound structure . Caller : Oh , and ... so , is the apartment furnished at all ? Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother 's old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother 's old dishwasher ? Okay . What 's the rent ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps . Does that include utilities ? Caller : Well , the rent includes gas and electricity , but not the phone bill . And the water pump is right out the back door . Caller : Water pump ! [ Yeah . ] Oh , yeah . Well , can I rent month - to - month , or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time ? Apartment Owner : We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment , and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period , hey ... you lose your deposit . Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 400 , and , of course , this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment , like the leaks in the old roof from last year 's snow storm . Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I did n't even know there was a rat 's nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That 's assuming that I even move in . Apartment Owner : Generally speaking , we return the deposit , minus a small fee for , you know , cleaning the apartment for the next tenant , but if you trash the place , then do n't expect to get anything back . Caller : Okay . Oh , um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It 's about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there 's a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it 's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there 's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you 'll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh ... I do n't know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there 's no guarantee it 'll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It 's one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah .... Are pets allowed ? Apartment Owner : Well , you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage , but we do n't allow larger animals like dogs , cats , or snakes . Things like that . Caller : Um , I have a rat ... Apartment Owner : You do n't have anything like that , do you ? Caller : Well , I have a rat that I keep in a cage . Will that be okay ? Apartment Owner : Well , as long it does n't escape , I guess that 's okay . Caller : And what 's your name ? Apartment Owner : It 's Norman . Norman Bates . Caller : Alright , Mr. Bates .

He came home yesterday and said he 'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher , Miss Sanderson . She said he did n't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing , of course , and Michael was very embarrassed about it . Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress . W : She 's engaged at the moment , I 'm afraid . This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she 's going to be free soon ... W : I have a feeling she 's going to be busy all morning , Mr. Holloway . She 's at a Governors ' meeting . It could go on for a very long time ... M : Oh . Well , in that case , perhaps you could help me . W : Of course . What form is Michael in ? M : He 's a first year . He 's in 1B. His form teacher 's Mr. Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that 's the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that 's what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I 'm just looking at the information booklet , Mr. Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I 've got it in front of me . W : You 're looking at the top of Page 11 , are n't you ? M : That 's right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you 'll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it 's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings are n't repeated . M : So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque ... W : I 'm afraid so . M : Oh well . Anything for a quiet life , I suppose .

    "passage": "Apartment Owner : Hello . Caller : Hi . I 'm calling about the ad for the apartment found in today 's newspaper . Apartment Owner : Okay . Caller : I 'm kind of desperate , and I need something right away . Apartment Owner : Okay . What would you like to know ? Caller : First of all , how big is it ? Apartment Owner : It 's a two - bedroom apartment with a living room , dining room and kitchen , and one bathroom . There 's also a place for a washer and dryer . Caller : Okay , and how old is the apartment complex ? Apartment Owner : Well , let 's just say it has a lot of history . To be honest , my great grandfather built it during the 1920s , but it 's a very sturdy and sound structure . Caller : Oh , and ... so , is the apartment furnished at all ? Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother 's old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother 's old dishwasher ? Okay . What 's the rent ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps . Does that include utilities ? Caller : Well , the rent includes gas and electricity , but not the phone bill . And the water pump is right out the back door . Caller : Water pump ! [ Yeah . ] Oh , yeah . Well , can I rent month - to - month , or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time ? Apartment Owner : We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment , and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period , hey ... you lose your deposit . Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 400 , and , of course , this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment , like the leaks in the old roof from last year 's snow storm . Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I did n't even know there was a rat 's nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That 's assuming that I even move in . Apartment Owner : Generally speaking , we return the deposit , minus a small fee for , you know , cleaning the apartment for the next tenant , but if you trash the place , then do n't expect to get anything back . Caller : Okay . Oh , um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It 's about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there 's a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it 's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there 's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you 'll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh ... I do n't know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there 's no guarantee it 'll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It 's one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah .... Are pets allowed ? Apartment Owner : Well , you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage , but we do n't allow larger animals like dogs , cats , or snakes . Things like that . Caller : Um , I have a rat ... Apartment Owner : You do n't have anything like that , do you ? Caller : Well , I have a rat that I keep in a cage . Will that be okay ? Apartment Owner : Well , as long it does n't escape , I guess that 's okay . Caller : And what 's your name ? Apartment Owner : It 's Norman . Norman Bates . Caller : Alright , Mr. Bates .

You can , err , .. , I suppose , stay in the college - owned flats , which are often near where you have your classes , and some are even on the campus . That would certainly be convenient .

Let me check to see if we have one available . Hmmm . It 's does n't look like we do . We have a couple of economy , compact , and full - size cars available , or a nice minivan . Customer : Well , what is the main difference between these cars ? Agent : The main difference is size . The economy car is the smallest , and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage . [ Okay . ] How many people are with you ? Customer : Just me and my son . Rental Car Agent : Well , the economy car would work . We have one right out front . Customer : Where ? That one ? It looks more like a shoebox to me . I 'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I do n't think so . Rental Car Agent : Well , if you need more room or comfort , I recommend the full - size car . It also has a nice stereo system , CD player , [ Alright ] safety rear door locks , and cruise control , and power locks and windows . Customer : Well , I 'm not so concerned about how it 's equipped . I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive . And what is the daily rate for that anyway ? Rental Car Agent : Well , let 's see here . Oh , yeah . It 'll come to fifty - seven ninety - five a day . Customer : Wow , a little expensive . But what 's the cost for mileage ? Rental Car Agent : Hey , all of our cars have unlimited miles , but of course , that does n't include gas . Customer : Yeah , right . I bet that car probably eats up gas , and now that were in the middle of the vacation season , gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices . Rental Car Agent : Well , as they say , it comes down to the law of supply an demand . Customer : Well , anyway , can you install a car seat in one of those cars ? I have a 3-year - old son with me . Rental Car Agent : Sure , and that 'll only be one dollar extra per day . Customer : I 'll go with the full - size car . Wait , uh ... what does it look like ? Rental Car Agent : Uh , it 's right out there in the parking lot . [ Which one ? ] The one over there next to the sidewalk . Customer : Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap ? Ahhh . Rental Car Agent : Sir , excuse me . We take pride in our vehicles . It 's just that it 's one of the last cars on our lot , but it runs like a dream . Do n't let the exterior fool you . Hey , I 'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers . Will there be any other drivers ? Customer : No , I 'm the only driver . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan ? Customer : What 's that exactly ? Rental Car Agent : Well , the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle , [ Okay ] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [ Oh ] . It even includes incidental road damage caused by , let 's say , a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car . [ Oh , uh , well ... ] . However , it wo n't cover loss of property due to theft . Too much crime in the area anyway . [ What ? Wh ... What about this crime ? What , what ? ] . Do n't worry about it . And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety - five per day . [ But you were saying ? ] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem . Customer : But would n't my own car insurance cover those problems ? Rental Car Agent : It might , but each insurance policy is different . With our car protection plan , however , you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [ Well ... ] , and we handle everything quickly , and you do n't have to contact your own insurance company . Okay . Let me just confirm this . A full - size car with a car seat for three days [ Yeah ] , plus the car protection package . Is that right ? [ That 's right . ] Okay , I 'll have our mechanic , Louie , check the car over and pull it up to the door . Customer : Push it up to the door ? I hope this car really runs .

    "passage": "M : Hello ? Beechgrove School ? This is Mr. Holloway speaking . Brad Holloway . I 'm ringing about my son Michael . He came home yesterday and said he 'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher , Miss Sanderson . She said he did n't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing , of course , and Michael was very embarrassed about it . Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress . W : She 's engaged at the moment , I 'm afraid . This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she 's going to be free soon ... W : I have a feeling she 's going to be busy all morning , Mr. Holloway . She 's at a Governors ' meeting . It could go on for a very long time ... M : Oh . Well , in that case , perhaps you could help me . W : Of course . What form is Michael in ? M : He 's a first year . He 's in 1B. His form teacher 's Mr. Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that 's the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that 's what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I 'm just looking at the information booklet , Mr. Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I 've got it in front of me . W : You 're looking at the top of Page 11 , are n't you ? M : That 's right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you 'll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it 's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings are n't repeated . M : So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque ... W : I 'm afraid so . M : Oh well . Anything for a quiet life , I suppose . Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit . W : Of course . Goodbye Mr. Holloway .",

    "passage": "Rental Car Agent : Hi . How can I help you ? Customer : Yeah . I 'd like to rent a mid - size car for three days . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Let me check to see if we have one available . Hmmm . It 's does n't look like we do . We have a couple of economy , compact , and full - size cars available , or a nice minivan . Customer : Well , what is the main difference between these cars ? Agent : The main difference is size . The economy car is the smallest , and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage . [ Okay . ] How many people are with you ? Customer : Just me and my son . Rental Car Agent : Well , the economy car would work . We have one right out front . Customer : Where ? That one ? It looks more like a shoebox to me . I 'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I do n't think so . Rental Car Agent : Well , if you need more room or comfort , I recommend the full - size car . It also has a nice stereo system , CD player , [ Alright ] safety rear door locks , and cruise control , and power locks and windows . Customer : Well , I 'm not so concerned about how it 's equipped . I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive . And what is the daily rate for that anyway ? Rental Car Agent : Well , let 's see here . Oh , yeah . It 'll come to fifty - seven ninety - five a day . Customer : Wow , a little expensive . But what 's the cost for mileage ? Rental Car Agent : Hey , all of our cars have unlimited miles , but of course , that does n't include gas . Customer : Yeah , right . I bet that car probably eats up gas , and now that were in the middle of the vacation season , gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices . Rental Car Agent : Well , as they say , it comes down to the law of supply an demand . Customer : Well , anyway , can you install a car seat in one of those cars ? I have a 3-year - old son with me . Rental Car Agent : Sure , and that 'll only be one dollar extra per day . Customer : I 'll go with the full - size car . Wait , uh ... what does it look like ? Rental Car Agent : Uh , it 's right out there in the parking lot . [ Which one ? ] The one over there next to the sidewalk . Customer : Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap ? Ahhh . Rental Car Agent : Sir , excuse me . We take pride in our vehicles . It 's just that it 's one of the last cars on our lot , but it runs like a dream . Do n't let the exterior fool you . Hey , I 'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers . Will there be any other drivers ? Customer : No , I 'm the only driver . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan ? Customer : What 's that exactly ? Rental Car Agent : Well , the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle , [ Okay ] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [ Oh ] . It even includes incidental road damage caused by , let 's say , a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car . [ Oh , uh , well ... ] . However , it wo n't cover loss of property due to theft . Too much crime in the area anyway . [ What ? Wh ... What about this crime ? What , what ? ] . Do n't worry about it . And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety - five per day . [ But you were saying ? ] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem . Customer : But would n't my own car insurance cover those problems ? Rental Car Agent : It might , but each insurance policy is different . With our car protection plan , however , you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [ Well ... ] , and we handle everything quickly , and you do n't have to contact your own insurance company . Okay . Let me just confirm this . A full - size car with a car seat for three days [ Yeah ] , plus the car protection package . Is that right ? [ That 's right . ] Okay , I 'll have our mechanic , Louie , check the car over and pull it up to the door . Customer : Push it up to the door ? I hope this car really runs . Rental Car Agent : Well , in case it does break down on some out - of - the - way , deserted road , just call the toll - free number for assistance . They 'll come to assist you within ... two business days . [ Two business days ! ! ! ] Enjoy your trip .",

Caller : I 'm kind of desperate , and I need something right away . Apartment Owner : Okay . What would you like to know ? Caller : First of all , how big is it ? Apartment Owner : It 's a two - bedroom apartment with a living room , dining room and kitchen , and one bathroom . There 's also a place for a washer and dryer . Caller : Okay , and how old is the apartment complex ? Apartment Owner : Well , let 's just say it has a lot of history . To be honest , my great grandfather built it during the 1920s , but it 's a very sturdy and sound structure . Caller : Oh , and ... so , is the apartment furnished at all ? Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother 's old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother 's old dishwasher ? Okay . What 's the rent ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps . Does that include utilities ? Caller : Well , the rent includes gas and electricity , but not the phone bill . And the water pump is right out the back door . Caller : Water pump ! [ Yeah . ] Oh , yeah . Well , can I rent month - to - month , or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time ? Apartment Owner : We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment , and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period , hey ... you lose your deposit . Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ? Apartment Owner : It 's $ 400 , and , of course , this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment , like the leaks in the old roof from last year 's snow storm . Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I did n't even know there was a rat 's nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That 's assuming that I even move in . Apartment Owner : Generally speaking , we return the deposit , minus a small fee for , you know , cleaning the apartment for the next tenant , but if you trash the place , then do n't expect to get anything back . Caller : Okay . Oh , um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It 's about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there 's a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it 's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there 's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you 'll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh ... I do n't know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there 's no guarantee it 'll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It 's one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah .... Are pets allowed ? Apartment Owner : Well , you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage , but we do n't allow larger animals like dogs , cats , or snakes . Things like that . Caller : Um , I have a rat ... Apartment Owner : You do n't have anything like that , do you ? Caller : Well , I have a rat that I keep in a cage . Will that be okay ? Apartment Owner : Well , as long it does n't escape , I guess that 's okay . Caller : And what 's your name ? Apartment Owner : It 's Norman . Norman Bates . Caller : Alright , Mr. Bates .

Customer : Well , what is the main difference between these cars ? Agent : The main difference is size . The economy car is the smallest , and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage . [ Okay . ] How many people are with you ? Customer : Just me and my son . Rental Car Agent : Well , the economy car would work . We have one right out front . Customer : Where ? That one ? It looks more like a shoebox to me . I 'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I do n't think so . Rental Car Agent : Well , if you need more room or comfort , I recommend the full - size car . It also has a nice stereo system , CD player , [ Alright ] safety rear door locks , and cruise control , and power locks and windows . Customer : Well , I 'm not so concerned about how it 's equipped . I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive . And what is the daily rate for that anyway ? Rental Car Agent : Well , let 's see here . Oh , yeah . It 'll come to fifty - seven ninety - five a day . Customer : Wow , a little expensive . But what 's the cost for mileage ? Rental Car Agent : Hey , all of our cars have unlimited miles , but of course , that does n't include gas . Customer : Yeah , right . I bet that car probably eats up gas , and now that were in the middle of the vacation season , gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices . Rental Car Agent : Well , as they say , it comes down to the law of supply an demand . Customer : Well , anyway , can you install a car seat in one of those cars ? I have a 3-year - old son with me . Rental Car Agent : Sure , and that 'll only be one dollar extra per day . Customer : I 'll go with the full - size car . Wait , uh ... what does it look like ?

Rental Car Agent : Sir , excuse me . We take pride in our vehicles . It 's just that it 's one of the last cars on our lot , but it runs like a dream . Do n't let the exterior fool you . Hey , I 'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers . Will there be any other drivers ? Customer : No , I 'm the only driver . Rental Car Agent : Okay . Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan ? Customer : What 's that exactly ? Rental Car Agent : Well , the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle , [ Okay ] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [ Oh ] . It even includes incidental road damage caused by , let 's say , a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car . [ Oh , uh , well ... ] . However , it wo n't cover loss of property due to theft . Too much crime in the area anyway . [ What ? Wh ... What about this crime ? What , what ? ] . Do n't worry about it . And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety - five per day . [ But you were saying ? ] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem . Customer : But would n't my own car insurance cover those problems ? Rental Car Agent : It might , but each insurance policy is different . With our car protection plan , however , you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [ Well ... ] , and we handle everything quickly , and you do n't have to contact your own insurance company . Okay . Let me just confirm this . A full - size car with a car seat for three days [ Yeah ] , plus the car protection package . Is that right ? [ That 's right . ] Okay , I 'll have our mechanic , Louie , check the car over and pull it up to the door . Customer : Push it up to the door ? I hope this car really runs .

    "passage": "M : Hello ? Beechgrove School ? This is Mr. Holloway speaking . Brad Holloway . I 'm ringing about my son Michael . He came home yesterday and said he 'd been in trouble at school with his P. E. teacher , Miss Sanderson . She said he did n't have the right kit for P. E. Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing , of course , and Michael was very embarrassed about it . Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress . W : She 's engaged at the moment , I 'm afraid . This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she 's going to be free soon ... W : I have a feeling she 's going to be busy all morning , Mr. Holloway . She 's at a Governors ' meeting . It could go on for a very long time ... M : Oh . Well , in that case , perhaps you could help me . W : Of course . What form is Michael in ? M : He 's a first year . He 's in 1B. His form teacher 's Mr. Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that 's the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that 's what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I 'm just looking at the information booklet , Mr. Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I 've got it in front of me . W : You 're looking at the top of Page 11 , are n't you ? M : That 's right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you 'll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it 's not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings are n't repeated . M : So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque ... W : I 'm afraid so . M : Oh well . Anything for a quiet life , I suppose . Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit . W : Of course . Goodbye Mr. Holloway .",
