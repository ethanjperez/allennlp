What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and . . . so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah. ] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey . . . you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um . . . how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh . . . I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um . . . and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah . . . . Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat . . . Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah.

Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks.

Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat . . . Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

W: I am interested in the pattern of political involvement of women in those western democracies.

M: It would be good to begin with a discussion of when women got the right to vote and how they use it. W: The record of women in politics in all those countries has been similar. None of them has women represented more than 10 percent of members of the national legislature. M: Remember, it is not what you think. You must back up your opinions with facts. Support for all your ideas is essential. I think you should check the statistics on what percentage of women hold political office in the national governments. W: Okay, I also plan to discuss the role of organized women's rights. M: That is a good idea, but remember this term-paper is only 5,000 words so you must keep your topic focused.

Did you know that we recently have a special offer which allows non-members to use our facilities without having to pay the membership fee? W: Oh, that's great. M: Yeah, but the offer is just until the end of this month. Anyway, let me tell you a little about the facilities at Spa Heaven, and you can decide what interests you. First, we have a fitness center where you can have a weight training so that you can lose some weight. W: And that sounds good, but I'm not really interested in getting fit. I just want to get rid of my tiredness and be energetic. M: In that case, you may be interested in our sports facilities. . . W: Mm, well, I like to go swimming and I find that helps me relax. Do you have any swimming facilities at your place? M: Certainly. We have two 25-meter pools here. W: Can you tell me how much that costs? M: Well, for non-members, it costs just $10 for each time. W: I think I need to do something more relaxing, though, you know, like meditation. Do you have anything like that? M: Well, meditation is part of our yoga classes, which we have every day. And during the special offer period, non-members can take part for just $35 per class. W: OK, thanks very much for your help. I'll come down this afternoon and arrange a yoga class.

M: Yes, I think this is true. But remember the old people themselves are often against the idea of going to live with a young family. You see, modern houses and flats are very small; much smaller than the sort of homes people used to live in. W: And when Granny gets very old, then the situation becomes even worse, doesn't it? M: Yes. As long as old people are able to look after themselves, the system works quite well. But as soon as they need any care and attention, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. It's likely that old people may go into a nursing home, but it's not as simple as that. Because of improvements in medical science, people live longer than ever before. The birth rate has fallen. This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention. The number of old people's homes provided by the State is strictly limited. There are private nursing homes, but the cost is out of reach of the average family. W: And how do you see the situation developing in the future? M: Well, obviously a lot of money is going to have to be spent. But it's difficult persuading people to do this.

We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars? Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay. ] How many people are with you? Customer: Just me and my son. Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing . . . I don't think so. Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day.
