W : Our school is for all children because a few of the children are physically disabled , and some of the others have learning difficulties . In our school , we have faster learners and slower learners . M : And is yours the only school like this ? W : That 's correct . Up till now , disabled children and those with learning difficulties were sent to special schools . They grew up in a different world . M : What made you decide to start this new school ? W : We realized that disabled children had no knowledge of children in ordinary schools . We thought it was important that all human beings should grow up together . M : Do the slower learners hold up the faster learners ? W : No . For some classes , slow learners and faster learners are separated . In other classes they all work together . M : How does that work ? W : Well . The faster learners help the slower learners . That way they become very skilled as teachers . When it 's time for the faster learners to do a task or do their homework , they do it more quickly and better too .",

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot . We made plans for trips . We discussed each other 's problems . After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful .

M : When Student Experience was founded , I was sharing an apartment with my sister Daisy . W : You two decided to set up the website together ? M : Not really .

But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week . First we tried setting fixed days : Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . But almost everyone was unhappy . Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot . We made plans for trips . We discussed each other 's problems . After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful .

Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest .

But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week . First we tried setting fixed days : Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . But almost everyone was unhappy . Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot . We made plans for trips . We discussed each other 's problems . After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful .

Then when we got to the hotel , we found our room had n't been cleaned . W : Oh , dear . Did you complain to the hotel staff ? M : Of course , but we were told all the cleaners were off duty . Anyway , that 's not all . The people in room above sounded like they were having all night parties every night . I demanded another room but the receptionist told me the hotel was full . W : Oh , I see . M : And the worst thing was the food in the restaurant was awful . It was so bad we had to eat out all the time despite having paid for meals in the price of our holiday .

Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal .

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days . For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea . They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports . Gradually , though , they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful . We loved a lot .

There is so much happening in everybody 's life . That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that . Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest . Also because people will sit down and say \" oh , here are my goals \" and forget all about them . Revisiting them every week is a good way .

Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month . That is , so different things get in their way and people do n't stand up for their goals . They do n't struggle for them . They let other forces push them around a little bit . Also , a lot of people do n't set goals ; they think they do . But it 's either a dream of very loose goal . So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they do n't act in its best interest . Also because people will sit down and say \" oh , here are my goals \" and forget all about them . Revisiting them every week is a good way .

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

M : 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5 . W : Really surprising , is n't it ? And what are your findings about people 's attitudes regarding obesity ? M : Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin . 83 % of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight . French are most likely to blame Americans . They use American 's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem . Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity . They are followed by Germans and Indians . When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight , the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor . W : Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey , we will be back soon after the break .",

It 's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night . Jason : What was the weather like ? Berry : The climate is very different from other places such as Peru or Bolivia . We were at sea level , and we all felt very good about it . No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time , and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid . Jason : That 's really nice . Berry : The first day we had very nice weather , and were able to really relax on the beach . After these two days we had bad weather , rain and cloudy . So , we 're a little bit disappointed about that . Due to the weather , we explored the old part of Rio . Jason : How about the food there ? Berry : We ate at local restaurant . Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $ 10 . Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat . Dessert and drinks are not included .

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

    "passage": "W : What does the term \" alternative energy source \" mean ? M : When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars , we think of petroleum , a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground , of which there is a limited supply . But alternative fuels can be many things . Wind , sun and water can all be used to create fuel . W : Is the threat of running out of petroleum real ? M : It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time . The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use . Most experts agree that by around 2025 , the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak . Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline . This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point . But it 'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract . W : Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources ? M : There are two very clear reasons to do so . One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left , we have to find other fuel sources eventually . So the sooner we start , the better off we will be . The other big argument is that when long time , which leads to some long - term negative effects , like global warming and the greenhouse effect .",

The department of weights and measures , we are a government agency . It 's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales . W : How did you check the scales before ? M : We have an old standard weight that we used to use . It had to be replaced because it was imprecise . You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous . It absorbed too much moisture . W : Oh . So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less . M : Exactly . And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country . So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal . W : How much did it cost ? M : About 45 thousand dollars . W : 45 000 dollars ? For one kilogram weight ? That 's more expensive than gold . Is it really worth that much ? M : I 'm sure it is . Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard .

It 's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night . Jason : What was the weather like ?

No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time , and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid . Jason : That 's really nice . Berry : The first day we had very nice weather , and were able to really relax on the beach . After these two days we had bad weather , rain and cloudy . So , we 're a little bit disappointed about that . Due to the weather , we explored the old part of Rio . Jason : How about the food there ? Berry : We ate at local restaurant . Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $ 10 . Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat . Dessert and drinks are not included .

W : Well , actually , it was about the evolution of sea life -- a continuation from last week . The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells . They survived by shedding their shells -- somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago . M : That 's a pretty long span of time . W : I know . That 's what she said , though . To be precise : \" Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained . \" M : Some squid are really huge . Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ? M : Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters . W : Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that have n't been found because squid are intelligent and fast --- so they can easily get away from humans . Maybe some of those monster stories are true .",

Maybe you should just try to forget about the people . Look at something else in the room like the exit sign . W : I guess I could try that but I doubt it 'll help . M : You know we talked about it in psychology class . Blushing , even though it 's unintentional , is more or less a learned behavior . W : What do you mean ?

W : First the fish is minced and cooked and fermented . Then water and starch are added to make a dough . M : It sounds awful . W : Actually the dough is very bland al that point , so the flavorings are added to give it some taste . M : Well , it still sounds a little strange . But I suppose this product will at least be low calorie and high protein . like a health food . W : Yes , you could call it that . And it has a long shelf life , so it wo n't spoil quickly . It is also easy to digest and can ha made from types of fish that usually are n't eaten , or from high grade fish by - products , M : Mm , have you got any samples ?

Good evening ! W : What would you like to talk about the great writer ? Maybe some details that we do n't quite know . M : OK , Mark Twain , who traveled quite a lot , often because circumstances , usually financial circumstances forced him to . He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835 , and moved to Hannibal , Missouri with his family when he was about four years old . Most people think he was born in Hannibal , but that is n't true . W : Yes , I did n't know it if you do n't tell us this evening . M : Well , after his father died when he was about twelve , Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money . He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers , and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi . W : Did Twain like that job ? M : He loved this job , and many of his books show it . The river job did n't last however , because of the outbreak of the Civil War . To avoid joining the army , he went west - California . Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe . Twain did n't travel much the last ten years of his life , and he did n't publish much either . Somehow his travel inspired his writings .

W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ?

If you do n't like a particular kind of big beans , you can go and buy another . But if you do n't like a particular railway , you ca n't go and use another . M : Some people who write to me say this . They say that if you did n't have a monopoly , you would n't be able to do the things you do . Well , I do n't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers . We have particular problems . Since 1946 , when the Transport Act came in , we were nationalized . W : Do you think that 's a good thing ? Has it been a good thing for the railways , do you think , to be nationalized ? M : Oh I think so , yes . Because in general , modes of transport are all around . Let 's face the fact . The car arrived . The car is here to stay . There is no question about that . W : So what are you saying then ? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized , they would simply have disappeared ? M : Oh , I think they would have . They 're disappearing fast in America . Er , the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year . The German railways , 2 billion pounds a year . But you see , those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going . W : So in a sense , you cope between two extremes . On the one hand , you 're trying not to lose too much money . And on the other hand , you 've got to provide the best service . M : Yes , you are right .",

No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time , and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid . Jason : That 's really nice .

So , we 're a little bit disappointed about that . Due to the weather , we explored the old part of Rio . Jason : How about the food there ? Berry : We ate at local restaurant .

The department of weights and measures , we are a government agency . It 's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales . W : How did you check the scales before ? M : We have an old standard weight that we used to use . It had to be replaced because it was imprecise . You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous . It absorbed too much moisture . W : Oh . So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less . M : Exactly . And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country . So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal . W : How much did it cost ? M : About 45 thousand dollars . W : 45 000 dollars ? For one kilogram weight ? That 's more expensive than gold . Is it really worth that much ? M : I 'm sure it is . Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard . Think of the drug industry , for example , those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine .",

Good evening ! W : What would you like to talk about the great writer ? Maybe some details that we do n't quite know . M : OK , Mark Twain , who traveled quite a lot , often because circumstances , usually financial circumstances forced him to .

He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers , and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi . W : Did Twain like that job ? M : He loved this job , and many of his books show it . The river job did n't last however , because of the outbreak of the Civil War . To avoid joining the army , he went west - California . Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe . Twain did n't travel much the last ten years of his life , and he did n't publish much either . Somehow his travel inspired his writings .

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there 's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly . And it may be that there was a gas blast . But , again , this has not been determined officially by anybody . W : I got you . When do kids come back to school ? M : Next Monday , and we will be ready for them . Monday January 4 .

W : Not to worry . Although it 's made primarily from fish , it actually does n't have a fishy taste . In fact , it can be flavored with tomato , cheese , or chocolate for instance M : How can it not taste fishy ? Do you know how this snack food is made ? W : First the fish is minced and cooked and fermented . Then water and starch are added to make a dough . M : It sounds awful . W : Actually the dough is very bland al that point , so the flavorings are added to give it some taste . M : Well , it still sounds a little strange . But I suppose this product will at least be low calorie and high protein . like a health food . W : Yes , you could call it that . And it has a long shelf life , so it wo n't spoil quickly . It is also easy to digest and can ha made from types of fish that usually are n't eaten , or from high grade fish by - products , M : Mm , have you got any samples ? I might be willing to try the cheese - flavored variety . W : No , none of it seems to be available yet . As I understand it , this fish snack food probably wo n't be in the stores for another couple of years . So you 'll have a while to get used to the whole idea . M : A couple of years , ah ? It may just take me that long . but thanks for telling me about it .",

You and I and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising . M : Well , I suppose we get something for our money , some information . W : Yes , but do n't forget it is often misleading information , and sometimes harmful . M : Harmful ? W : What about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes ?

W : Well , actually , it was about the evolution of sea life -- a continuation from last week . The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells . They survived by shedding their shells -- somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago . M : That 's a pretty long span of time . W : I know . That 's what she said , though . To be precise : \" Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained . \" M : Some squid are really huge . Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ? M : Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters .

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

W : Have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem ? M : No . I would n't know anything more about the stove itself . All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there 's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly . And it may be that there was a gas blast . But , again , this has not been determined officially by anybody . W : I got you . When do kids come back to school ? M : Next Monday , and we will be ready for them . Monday January 4 . We 're just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that 's because of the fire fighters that were here , nine of them . They 're wonderful . W : And I 'm sure you send your thanks out to them , uh ? M : Well , we 're sending out thanks to them in a letter or in any other way we can .

W : Well , actually , it was about the evolution of sea life -- a continuation from last week . The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells . They survived by shedding their shells -- somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago . M : That 's a pretty long span of time . W : I know . That 's what she said , though . To be precise : \" Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained . \" M : Some squid are really huge . Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell ? W : Actually , it 's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size . M : Makes sense . But some are really huge . I 've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton . Did she talk about how that happens ? W : Not really . But she did mention some unusual cases . In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid .. , let 's see here .. , it was twenty - two yards long . Its eyes were eighteen inches across . Can you imagine ? M : Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters . W : Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that have n't been found because squid are intelligent and fast --- so they can easily get away from humans . Maybe some of those monster stories are true .",

Good evening ! W : What would you like to talk about the great writer ? Maybe some details that we do n't quite know . M : OK , Mark Twain , who traveled quite a lot , often because circumstances , usually financial circumstances forced him to .

M : He loved this job , and many of his books show it . The river job did n't last however , because of the outbreak of the Civil War . To avoid joining the army , he went west - California . Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe . Twain did n't travel much the last ten years of his life , and he did n't publish much either . Somehow his travel inspired his writings .

You and I and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising . M : Well , I suppose we get something for our money , some information . W : Yes , but do n't forget it is often misleading information , and sometimes harmful . M : Harmful ? W : What about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes ?

Good evening ! W : What would you like to talk about the great writer ? Maybe some details that we do n't quite know . M : OK , Mark Twain , who traveled quite a lot , often because circumstances , usually financial circumstances forced him to . He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835 , and moved to Hannibal , Missouri with his family when he was about four years old . Most people think he was born in Hannibal , but that is n't true . W : Yes , I did n't know it if you do n't tell us this evening . M : Well , after his father died when he was about twelve , Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money . He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers , and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi . W : Did Twain like that job ? M : He loved this job , and many of his books show it . The river job did n't last however , because of the outbreak of the Civil War . To avoid joining the army , he went west - California . Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck . W : That 's interesting ! M : But he did succeed as a writer , once that happened , Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe . Twain did n't travel much the last ten years of his life , and he did n't publish much either . Somehow his travel inspired his writings .

M : What 's there to say ? We must have advertising , must n't we ? W : Why ? M : Well , we would n't know what there was to buy if we did n't have advertisements . W : Yes , that 's true . Up to a point , advertisements provide information that we need . IF someone has produced a new article , naturally , the seller wants to tell us about it . M : Yes , and the advertisements tell us which product is the best . W : Do they ? I do n't think so . Every manufacture says that his product is the best , or at least tries to give the impression . Only one can be the best , so the others are misleading , are n't they ? M : Well , in a way , I suppose , but we do n't have to believe them , do we ? W : Are you saying that advertisements are n't effective ? I do n't think that intelligent businessmen will spend millions of dollars on advertising if nobody believes the advertisements , do you ? M : Perhaps not , but after all , it 's their money that they are spending . W : Is it ? I think not . The cost of advertising is added to the price of the article . You and I and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising . M : Well , I suppose we get something for our money , some information . W : Yes , but do n't forget it is often misleading information , and sometimes harmful . M : Harmful ? W : What about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes ? Would n't you say the are harmful ? M : You 've given me a lot to think about . I 'm quite looking forward to the debate now .",

You see , what I 'd really like to do is to go by plane . Can you tell me about that ? M : Yes , of course . Let me see , 78 pounds for a single . But it takes just over an hour . W : Really ? M : Yes , you 're there in no time . W : Wonderful . That 'll be a wonderful start to the holiday . M : Shall I book a ticket ? W : Well , look . I really ought to think about it .

W : It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace . In my opinion , communication means interaction and is vital in business . It ensures smooth operation between staff members , employers and clients . M : Can you explain that more precisely ? W : Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees , while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers . M : Do you say communication means talking to others ? W : Well , communication does n't always refer to conversations . M : Like what ? W : For instance , written communication . It is very important in business . Mostly , being in the business area , communicating for the first time with someone , for example a client , is made through e - mails . Thus , writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression . So your writing skills have to be very good and professional . M : Besides the work communication with business clients , how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues ? W : Regardless of how good you are at your job , if you do n't form at least basic relationships with those around you , it will ultimately affect your career success . M : What you 've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization . W : Not really , the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior . Actually , some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members . You know , bad communication leads to misunderstandings . Meanwhile , the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients . To ensure that business continues to grow , a company 's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees . This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication .",

    "passage": "W : This is Lisa Meyer in the WBZ newsroom , talking with Mike Bassichis , who is the director of the Gifford School , about the cleanup from last week 's fire and what the possible cause of that blaze may have been . M : We 're getting ready for our entire staff to return early from vacation tomorrow whereupon we are going to move into temporary classrooms . And the other buildings that did not burn are being de - smoked . As to the cause of the fire , all we know is that we were having trouble with the pilot lights since we bought the stove in July and it had been serviced three times . Well , as a matter of fact , we think it was a malfunctioning stove that may have caused the fire . Nothing definite yet has been determined . W : Have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem ? M : No . I would n't know anything more about the stove itself . All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there 's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly . And it may be that there was a gas blast . But , again , this has not been determined officially by anybody . W : I got you . When do kids come back to school ? M : Next Monday , and we will be ready for them . Monday January 4 . We 're just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that 's because of the fire fighters that were here , nine of them . They 're wonderful . W : And I 'm sure you send your thanks out to them , uh ? M : Well , we 're sending out thanks to them in a letter or in any other way we can . I heard a story today where one of our kids actually baked some cookies and is taking it to the fire department , to give it to them .",

Teacher : Well , you know , junior high school is a difficult time , but she just needs to speak up a little more in class . I think ... Parent : No , it 's ... it 's more than that . Some of the kids in your class have really been bullying her a lot . Teacher : What do you mean ? Parent : Well , um , they 've been teasing her a lot about her appearance , and then , the other day , you did n't help things [ What ? ] Yeah , she said you made a comment about her clothes . Teacher : What do you mean ? I mean ... Parent : She said you commented on her shirt and jeans , like they were from the 1970s or something like that . Teacher : Well I was just kind of joking a little bit with her . Parent : Well , yeah , that 's what you think , but other kids follow your example . In fact , one of the kids took a picture of her with their phone and posted it and had some real nasty comments on Facebook . It was terrible . Teacher : Well , you know , kids can be kids . Parent : No , do n't you get it ? This is bullying ; it 's cyberbullying , and adults like you are part of the problem . Forget it . I 'm planning on discussing this with the principal tomorrow . Teacher : Oh , wait , wait , wait . Um , uh , oh . I 'm sorry if I hurt her feelings [ Yeah . You did ! ] , but ... Parent : I get sick and tired of people thinking that a little teasing is okay . Too many kids are killing themselves because they feel that there 's just no way to escape this . Teacher : Okay . Well , I guess I need to be a little bit more careful , but ... Parent : Yeah , you do . I really hope I can get Megan to come to school tomorrow . She 's been really , really anxious and depressed [ Wow . ] for some time , and your comments and those that the other kids made have n't helped . Teacher : Wow . Uh , I 'm really sorry .

Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "W : Hello , Freddie . M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How 's everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

Diane : Fine . Well , let 's get some details . What kind of apartment is it ? Gavin : It 's a two - bedroom apartment . Diane : What floor is it on ? Gavin : Why do you need to know that ?

M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

    "passage": "Program Host : Hi and welcome to our new show , Exotic Animal Kingdom , a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old . In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

Diane : Fine . Well , let 's get some details . What kind of apartment is it ? Gavin : It 's a two - bedroom apartment . Diane : What floor is it on ? Gavin : Why do you need to know that ?

    "passage": "Program Host : Hi and welcome to our new show , Exotic Animal Kingdom , a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old . In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

Jake : They say it rains cats and dogs in the spring , but again , I 'll probably just wait and pick up a raincoat or an umbrella later on . But , I 'm going to take a good pair of shoes because I plan on walking to and from school everyday . Ashley : Do you need any clothing for formal occasions ? Jake : Well , you never know when you might need something on the spur of the moment for a wedding or maybe someone 's graduation , or a nice date , so I 'll probably take some nice slacks , a dress shirt , and a couple ( of ) crazy ties or two . Ashley : Um , that makes sense . Jake : And I 'll just rent a suit or tuxedo if I need anything more formal . Hey , maybe I 'll get married . Ashley : You ? Married ? Hah ! Jake : Wait . What are you trying to say ? Ashley : I just ca n't imagine you decked out in a tuxedo for any formal occasion . [ What ? ! ] I mean , for high school graduation , you wore an old pair of jeans and tennis shoes . Jake : Hey , there was a reason for that , so let me explain . [ Yeah , ha , ha . ] No , really .

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",

    "passage": "Program Host : Hi and welcome to our new show , Exotic Animal Kingdom , a program geared toward introducing animals to the young and old . In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

I 'm pretty sure she 's using drugs again , and you really need to , you need to know this ... you really need to face the facts , and you 're going to have to deal with this now . Brandon : So , but , I ... again , how do you know ? Stacy : She 's doing some of the same stuff , you know , um , like . Well , like . Listen , you know . Um , you 've noticed she 's been skipping work lately ? Brandon : Well , she said she 's been having some health problems , so I just figured it was that . Stacy : No , no , no . She 's not . [ Are you sure ? ] Yeah . It 's , it 's more than that . Like , a month ago , she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car . Brandon : Wow . Man . Um , I mean , she did n't tell me anything like that . I mean , her car is running fine , I think . Stacy : Yeah , I know , it is . It 's running fine . [ Oh , great . ] Exactly . She 's lying a lot now , and she 's , you know , she 's trying to hide it , and she 's good at hiding it . Brandon : And , I let her borrow my car a couple days ago , and I had fifty bucks in there , and when the car came back , it was gone . She 's ... I do n't know how else it could have disappeared . [ Man . I ca n't belive this . ] I 'm pretty sure she stole it . Stacy : I know . Um , but she 's hiding things , and she hides things from us , and okay , for example , like last week . I saw her with the two cell phones , and when I checked the texts on the one phone .... Brandon : Wait , wait . Two phones ? What do you mean ? Stacy : .... Yeah , umm . Brandon : She only has one . Stacy : No , she 's got at least two phones , and when I checked the one phone , I saw some texts , and she was talking about , um , um , some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them . Brandon : Ah , man . Stacy : I 'm sorry , Brandon , um , I ... we need to , we need to confront her on this . You need to confront her on this . Brandon : I do n't know how to do this . I mean ... yeah , I do n't know . Stacy : I know , but you 've got to . You , you ca n't ... the ... you know , you 've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there 's going to be anything to this relationship . It 's , it 's much better to talk to her openly about this now , cause , I promise you , the problems will just escalate , so ... Brandon : But , she might blow up . Stacy : She might , but hey , wait , listen . Why do n't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together ? You know , um ... Brandon : I just do n't know . Stacy : I know , and you 're right , she might blow up , but if you do n't do anything , I promise the problems are just going to get bigger . She 's probably going to end up losing her job , she 's probably going to get arrested , and she might even die . Brandon : Man , you 're probably right . I have to think about this and how to approach her . Alright . Let , let me thing about it , and I 'll call you . [ Okay . ] Alright , thanks . Stacy : Alright . Bye , Brandon .",

In today 's show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why do n't you hold on to Bert , [ Oh ... Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure ... Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let 's get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores ... Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb ... Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : ... to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees . Program Host : Okay , and I do n't think they need sun tan lotion , right ? [ No ] . Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ? Guest : Well , actually , you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight ; however , putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight wo n't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need . Program Host : Wow ! I did n't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that . Well , thanks very much for joining us today , Joshua . Guest : My pleasure .",

    "passage": "W : Hello , Freddie . M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How 's everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I 'm afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we 've got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , ... to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm ... W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I ca n't see , I ca n't see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh ... W : Well , they are n't being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of ... a new airport here . W : But , but really people should n't be traveling that much , that 's , that 's why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It is n't necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it is n't necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , is n't it ? M : But the airport infra , ... , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it 's , it 's just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it wo n't be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important . And this means travel , and means quick travel , air travel . And we just need a new airport .",

    "passage": "F : Well , I 'm sure all our listeners would love to be brought up to date on the latest in tiny televisions . M : It 's an expanding market , that 's for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it 's Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I 'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982 , but they still could n't keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what 's it like ? M : Well , it 's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less ... F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that 's H - A - T - T - O - R - I -- you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it 's about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they 're connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that 's plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that 's C - A - S - I - O. Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there 's one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they 're planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ? M : Mainly the commuters who spend hours going to and from work . These TVs will provide relief from the monotonous train and bus rides . F : Well , thank you for keeping us in touch with this extremely popular gadget . M : My pleasure , and happy viewing to all of you with those TVs .",
