What the scientists input is sent by telephone lines to the computer , and after a time , copies of the designs are needed back in Felton as possible . Lockheed people have tried several ways of sending the prints , but the most effective seems to be by pigeon . Are pigeons really used to carry messages in these days ? They are , and they send the prints faster and cheaper than any other way . Human messengers ( persons carrying messages ) are much more expensive and slower than the pigeons . The road to Felton goes through the mountains , and the driving is not easy . An electronic printout system could do the work in Felton , but at a cost of 10 dollars a print . Pigeons carry the designs for about 1 dollar each . Now Lockheed people have ten pigeon messengers . The pigeons do the work , and they have made Lockheed more famous . You can often read the news about the pigeons in the newspapers around the world .",

Fire is one of man 's greatest friends , but also one of his greatest enemies . Many big fires are caused by carelessness . A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire . Sometimes , though , a fire can start on its own . Wet hay can begin burning by itself . This is how it happens : the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it . Finally , it bursts into flames . That 's why farmers cut and store their hay when it 's dry . Fires have destroyed whole cities . In the 17th century , a small fire which began in a baker 's shop burnt down nearly every building in London . Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon . This fire continued burning for seven days . And , of course , in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome .

Fire is one of man 's greatest friends , but also one of his greatest enemies . Many big fires are caused by carelessness . A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire . Sometimes , though , a fire can start on its own . Wet hay can begin burning by itself . This is how it happens : the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it . Finally , it bursts into flames . That 's why farmers cut and store their hay when it 's dry . Fires have destroyed whole cities . In the 17th century , a small fire which began in a baker 's shop burnt down nearly every building in London . Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon . This fire continued burning for seven days . And , of course , in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome .

You do n't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy . Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness : Do n't skip meals . Before you leave home , have a small , low - fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods . Control the amount of food . Use a small plate that may encourage you to \" load up \" . You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist . Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables . Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food .

Ireland became so dependent on it that thousands of Irish people starved when the crop failed during the years of 1845 - -1846 , and thousands more were forced to go to live in America .

Knowing how to make an invisible ink message will have you feeling like a secret agent in no time . These are instructions for making invisible ink using baking soda . Difficulty : Easy Time required : A few minutes What you need : Baking soda , Paper , Water , Light bulb , Paintbrush , Measuring cup , Purple grape juice Here 's how : There are at least two methods of using baking soda as invisible ink . Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda . Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper , using the baking soda solution as \" ink \" . Allow the ink to dry . One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source , such as a light bulb . The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown . The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice . The message will appear in a different color1 . Tips : If you are using the heating method , avoid burning the paper . Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid - base reaction , producing a color1 change in the paper . Grape juice concentrate results in a more visible color1 change than regular grape juice .",

    "passage": "Do you love holidays but hate gaining weight ? You are not alone . Holidays are times for celebrating . Many people are worried about their weight . With proper planning , though , it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays . The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much . You do n't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy . Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness : Do n't skip meals . Before you leave home , have a small , low - fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods . Control the amount of food . Use a small plate that may encourage you to \" load up \" . You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist . Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables . Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food . Stick to physical activity . Do n't let exercise take a break during the holidays . A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories.(238 words )",

    "passage": "Americans often say that there are only two things a person can be sure of : death and taxes . Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world . Taxes are the money that people pay to support their government . There are generally three levels of government in the United States : federal , state , and city;therefore , there are three types of taxes . Salaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part . It depends on their salaries . The federal government has a two - level income tax : that is,15 or 28 percent.$17 850 is the cut off . The tax rate is 15 percent below $ 17 850 and 28 percent above . The second tax is for the state government : New York , California , or any of the other forty - eight states . Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government . Of course , the percentage for the state tax is lower . Other states have a sales tax , which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state . Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues(=annual income ) . The third tax is for the city . This tax comes in two forms : property tax(people who own a home have to pay taxes on it ) and excise tax , which is collected on vehicles in a city . The cities use this money for education , police , public works , etc . Since Americans pay such high taxes , they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes . People always complain about taxes . They often say that the government misuses their tax dollars . They all believe that taxes are too high in this country .",

Rudolf Trabold , a spokesman for the museum , said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone . People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

In 1044 , Song Dynasty , Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun , the ancient name of Yueyang City . In the second year , he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower . Fan Zhongyan , a great artist and poet , was invited to write the well - known poem about Yueyang Tower . In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower ( < < > > ) , Fan writes : \" Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land , the last to enjoy universal happiness . \" His words have been well - known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before . The style of Yueyang Tower is quite special . The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories , flying eave and wood construction , the helmet - roof of such a large size is a rarity among the ancient architectures in China . Entering the tower , you 'll see \" Dongting is the water of the world , Yueyang is the tower of the world \" . Moving on , there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three - Kingdom Period general Lu Su . To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion in honor of Du Fu .

    "passage": "For years we have been dieting strictly after the year - end overeating , afraid that when summer . comes , the bigger size we have accumulated will betray how we ate . Now scientists say , it 's a little bug that causes obesity . As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives , millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures . But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates , but some bacteria in your guts . Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity . A research team led by Zhao Liping , a professor in Shanghai , has identified a precise link between a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain . \" The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat . And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat , \" Zhao says . Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut , microbiota , may play a very important role in weight gain , but they had never been able to prove it . In 2004 , American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice . While a link was believed to exist , proving it was another matter . \" The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing , \" says Lita Proctor , director of the US National Institutes of Health . \" But the problem is that we 're only able to look at associations and are n't yet able to conduct cause - and - effect studies . \" In the clinical study , researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin - producing bacteria , leading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria , in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg . Based on this information , researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts . After 23 weeks , the patient lost 51.4 kg , with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared .",

    "passage": "To err is human . To blame the other guy is even more human . Common sense is not all that common . Why tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse ? These three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes , and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err , or to make mistakes , is indeed a part of being human , but it seems that most people do n't want to accept the responsibility for the problem . Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this : \" To err is human , to forgive , divine .\"This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others ' mistakes . Instead , we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to . However , taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity . Common sense is what we call clear thought . Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well , and it also means staying with the plan . Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm , but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine . Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations , because there are so many things going on that one person can not be in charge of everything . People say that in a large company , \" the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing . \" And what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art ? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people , especially young people , get the idea that it 's okay not to be totally honest all the time . There is a corollary to that : if good excuse is \" good \" even if it is n't honest , then where is the place of the truth ?",

    "passage": "Americans often say that there are only two things a person can be sure of : death and taxes . Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world . Taxes are the money that people pay to support their government . There are generally three levels of government in the United States : federal , state , and city;therefore , there are three types of taxes . Salaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part . It depends on their salaries . The federal government has a two - level income tax : that is,15 or 28 percent.$17 850 is the cut off . The tax rate is 15 percent below $ 17 850 and 28 percent above . The second tax is for the state government : New York , California , or any of the other forty - eight states . Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government . Of course , the percentage for the state tax is lower . Other states have a sales tax , which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state . Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues(=annual income ) . The third tax is for the city . This tax comes in two forms : property tax(people who own a home have to pay taxes on it ) and excise tax , which is collected on vehicles in a city . The cities use this money for education , police , public works , etc . Since Americans pay such high taxes , they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes . People always complain about taxes . They often say that the government misuses their tax dollars . They all believe that taxes are too high in this country .",

    "passage": "Yueyang Tower lies in the west of Yueyang City , near the Dongting Lake . It was first built for soldiers to rest on and watch out . In the Three Kingdoms Period , Lu Su , General of Wu State , trained his soldiers here . In 716 , Kaiyuan of Tang Dynasty , General Zhang Shuo was sent to defend at Yuezhou and he rebuilt it into a tower named South Tower , and then Yueyang Tower . In 1044 , Song Dynasty , Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun , the ancient name of Yueyang City . In the second year , he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower . Fan Zhongyan , a great artist and poet , was invited to write the well - known poem about Yueyang Tower . In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower ( < < > > ) , Fan writes : \" Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land , the last to enjoy universal happiness . \" His words have been well - known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before . The style of Yueyang Tower is quite special . The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories , flying eave and wood construction , the helmet - roof of such a large size is a rarity among the ancient architectures in China . Entering the tower , you 'll see \" Dongting is the water of the world , Yueyang is the tower of the world \" . Moving on , there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three - Kingdom Period general Lu Su . To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion in honor of Du Fu . Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door , the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides . In the garden to the north of the tower is the tomb of Xiaoqiao , the wife of Zhou Yu .",

    "passage": "\" Hitler and the Germans , \" an exhibition in Berlin 's German Historical Museum which aims to investigate the society that created Hitler , has seen more than 10,000 visitors walk through its doors since opening on Friday . Rudolf Trabold , a spokesman for the museum , said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone . People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

Rudolf Trabold , a spokesman for the museum , said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone . People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

Now scientists say , it 's a little bug that causes obesity . As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives , millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures . But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates , but some bacteria in your guts . Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity . A research team led by Zhao Liping , a professor in Shanghai , has identified a precise link between a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain . \" The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat . And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat , \" Zhao says . Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut , microbiota , may play a very important role in weight gain , but they had never been able to prove it . In 2004 , American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice . While a link was believed to exist , proving it was another matter . \" The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing , \" says Lita Proctor , director of the US National Institutes of Health . \" But the problem is that we 're only able to look at associations and are n't yet able to conduct cause - and - effect studies . \" In the clinical study , researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin - producing bacteria , leading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria , in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg . Based on this information , researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts . After 23 weeks , the patient lost 51.4 kg , with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared .",

How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone ? You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person . Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad , angry , scared , or worried . Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship . In unhealthy relationships , there is an unfair balance . You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you . You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets . In a healthy relationship , you like to spend time with the other person , instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her .",

    "passage": "\" What is the most important thing you 've done in your life ? \" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers . The answer came to me in an instant . It 's not the one I gave , because the situation was not right . As a lawyer in the entertainment industry , I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well - known people , but here 's the true answer : The most important thing I 've ever done occurred on October 8,1990 . I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I had n't seen for a while . Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other 's lives . He and his wife had just had a baby boy , who was keeping them up at night . While we were playing , a car came screaming up the road toward the courts . It was my friend 's father , who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital . In a flash my friend was in the car and gone , disappearing in a cloud of dust . For a moment I just stood there , paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do . Follow my friend to the hospital ? There was nothing I could accomplish there , I convinced myself . My friend 's son was in the care of doctors and nurses , and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome . Be there for moral support ? Well , maybe . But my friend and his wife both had large families , and I knew they 'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support , whatever happened . All I could do at the hospital , I decided , was to get in the way . Also , I had planned a full day with my family , who were waiting for me to get home . So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later . As I started my car , I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts . I now faced another problem . I could n't leave the keys in the truck . So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys . When I arrived , I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting . As I had thought , the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife . I went in and stood by the door , trying to decide what to do next . Soon a doctor appeared . He approached my friend and his wife , and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died . For a long time the two held each other and cried , unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence . After they had calmed themselves , the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son . My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families . When they reached the door , my friend saw me standing in the corner . He came over and hugged me and started to cry . My friend 's wife hugged me , too , and said , \" Thanks for being here . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . It 's the most important thing I have ever done . The experience taught me two lessons . First : The most important thing I 've ever done happened when I was completely helpless . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Something terrible was happening to people I cared about , and I was powerless to change the outcome . All I could do was standing by and watching it happen . And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me . Second : The most important thing I 've done almost did n't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . These skills are critical for lawyers . When people come to us for help , they 're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically . But while learning to think , I almost forget how to feel . Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life is n't the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",

None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Something terrible was happening to people I cared about , and I was powerless to change the outcome . All I could do was standing by and watching it happen . And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me . Second : The most important thing I 've done almost did n't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . These skills are critical for lawyers . When people come to us for help , they 're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically . But while learning to think , I almost forget how to feel . Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life is n't the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",
