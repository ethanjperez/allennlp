Such electronic products make the brain more active , and then influence their sleep . But according to a latest survey , more than 90 % of Americans regularly use a computer or some other kinds of electronic products in the hour before bed . Researchers are finding that man - made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals that help sleep . The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle . In the study , the researchers let volunteers read , play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring how much light their eyes received . They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22 % . Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results . And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness , but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes and other diseases . To be on the safe side , the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed , or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible . .",

Researchers are finding that man - made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals that help sleep . The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle . In the study , the researchers let volunteers read , play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring how much light their eyes received . They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22 % . Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results . And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness , but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes and other diseases . To be on the safe side , the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed , or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible . .",

    "passage": "To understand why the Earth is warming up , first of all , we need to understand why it is warm . Our planet is covered with atmosphere . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth . The Sun heats up the Earth 's surface . When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming can not be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down . But every little thing each person can do to save energy and our forests will help . Think about our planet .

Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth . The Sun heats up the Earth 's surface . When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming can not be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals . But at other times he spent hours before the picture , lost in contemplation , examining , comparing , and measuring his figures . This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior , the head of the church , who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems , the more he accomplishes ; and so he tried to find fault with the idle painter .

The creative artist needs time for contemplation ; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest . Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture : that of Christ , for which no model on earth could be found , for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength , and beauty , and tenderness , and deep sorrow of the Christ ; then he also needed a head of Judas , and that was hard to find as well , for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor .

    "passage": "Much of the water we use comes from snow . Melting snow provides water for rivers , electric power centers and agricultural crops . In the western United States , mountain snow provides up to 75 % of all surface water supplies . Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold , winter weather . Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving , the movement of heat is greatly reduced . Snow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves . When there is fresh snow on the ground , the surface of the snow takes in , or absorbs , sound waves . However , snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds . Then the snow 's surface will help to send back sound waves . Under these conditions , sounds may seem clearer and travel farther . Generally , the color of snow and ice appears white . This is because the light we see from the sun is white . Most natural materials take in some sunlight . This gives them their color . However , when light travels from air to snow , some light is sent back , or reflected . Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight . Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight . It is this light that gives snow its white appearance . Sometimes , snow or ice may appear to be blue . The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice . In simple terms , think of snow or ice as a filter . A filter is designed to reject some substances , while permitting others to pass through . In the case of snow , all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick . If it is a meter or more thick , however , blue light often can be seen .",

She could recite bedtime stories . \" We 'd be driving around in the car and she would recite her bedtime stories from the night before . She did n't just recite them , and she recited them exactly . \" Alexis ' father would try to trick her and say that her story went a different way , but she always corrected him . Most 12-month - old children take their first steps on their own and most 18-month - olds can only name a small number of objects and body parts , and follow simple two - step questions . Even though Alexis is a genius , her parents are faced with lots of challenges like how to teach her to make friends of her own age . \" Will she go into kindergarten early ? We are kind of hesitant because we do want her to get to that social world , \" Ian said .",

    "passage": "The Last Supper is regarded as one of the supreme masterpieces in the whole field of pictorial art . Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting , the monks in the church annoyed at the delay . It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals . But at other times he spent hours before the picture , lost in contemplation , examining , comparing , and measuring his figures . This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior , the head of the church , who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems , the more he accomplishes ; and so he tried to find fault with the idle painter . Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation ; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest . Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture : that of Christ , for which no model on earth could be found , for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength , and beauty , and tenderness , and deep sorrow of the Christ ; then he also needed a head of Judas , and that was hard to find as well , for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor . But he would look no further ; if none came his way , he would be satisfied to take Prior as a model for Judas .

It 's the only one that can never be true . Today , if a bank statement cheats you out of $ 900 that way , you know what the clerk is sure to say : \" It was a computer error . \" Nonsense . The computer is reporting nothing more than what the clerk typed into it . The most annoying case of all is when the computerized cash register in the grocery store shows that an item costs more than it actually does . If the innocent buyer points out the mistake , the checker , bagger and manager all come together and offer the familiar explanation : \" It was a computer error . \" It was n't , of course . That high - tech cash register is really nothing more than an electric eye . The eye reads the Universal Product Code -- that ribbon of black and white lines on the package --and then checks the code against a price list stored in memory . If the price list is right , you 'll be charged accurately . Grocery stores update the price list each day -- that is , somebody sits at a keyboard and types in the prices . If the price they type in is too high , there are only two explanations : carelessness or dishonesty . But somehow \" a computer error \" is supposed to excuse everything . One reason we let people hide behind a computer is the common misunderstanding that huge , modern computers are \" electric brains \" with \" artificial intelligence . \" At some point there might be a machine with intelligence , but none exists today .

But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo , which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies . Kodak 's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation . The bid went instead to Fuji , which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace .",

It 's the only one that can never be true . Today , if a bank statement cheats you out of $ 900 that way , you know what the clerk is sure to say : \" It was a computer error . \" Nonsense . The computer is reporting nothing more than what the clerk typed into it . The most annoying case of all is when the computerized cash register in the grocery store shows that an item costs more than it actually does . If the innocent buyer points out the mistake , the checker , bagger and manager all come together and offer the familiar explanation : \" It was a computer error . \" It was n't , of course . That high - tech cash register is really nothing more than an electric eye . The eye reads the Universal Product Code -- that ribbon of black and white lines on the package --and then checks the code against a price list stored in memory . If the price list is right , you 'll be charged accurately . Grocery stores update the price list each day -- that is , somebody sits at a keyboard and types in the prices . If the price they type in is too high , there are only two explanations : carelessness or dishonesty . But somehow \" a computer error \" is supposed to excuse everything . One reason we let people hide behind a computer is the common misunderstanding that huge , modern computers are \" electric brains \" with \" artificial intelligence . \" At some point there might be a machine with intelligence , but none exists today . The smartest computer on earth right now is no more \" intelligent \" than your average screwdriver .

    "passage": "Kodak 's decision to file for bankruptcy protection is a sad , though not unexpected , turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades , but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution . Although many attribute Kodak 's downfall to \" complacency , \" that explanation does n't acknowledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself . Decades ago , Kodak predicted that digital photography would overtake film -- and in fact , Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision , the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business . \" It was n't that Kodak was blind to the future \" , said Rebecca Henderson , a professor at Harvard Business School , but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it . By the time the company realized its mistake , it was too late . Kodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt , and spent a lot of money trying to do so , but ultimately failed . Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses . Although Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography , its corporate culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future . They were a company stuck in time . Their history was so important to them . Now their history has become a liability . Kodak 's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic . In 1976 , the company commanded 90 % of the market for photographic film and 85 % of the market for cameras .

    "passage": "Wilderness \" In wilderness is the preservation of the world . \" This is a famous saying from a writer regarded as one of the fathers of environmentalism . The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection : whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved . As John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out , there is a strong appeal in images of the wild , the untouched ; more than anything else , they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly . The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong , and the danger exploitation brings to such landscapes is real . Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need -- the rainforests , for example , store carbon in vast quantities . To Mr . Sauven , these \" ecosystem services \" far outweigh the gains from exploitation . Lee Lane , a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute , takes the opposing view . He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services , such as water conservation . But that is not , he argues , a reason to avoid all human presence , or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation . There are ever more people on the Earth , and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives , rather than merely struggle for survival . While the ways of using resources have improved , there is still a growing need for raw materials , and some wildernesses contain them in abundance . If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide , the argument goes , there is no further reason not to do so . Being untouched is not , in itself , a characteristic worth valuing above all others . I look forwards to seeing these views taken further , and to their being challenged by the other participants . One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly . And there is a practical question as to whether wildernesses can be exploited without harm . This is a topic that calls for not only free expression of feelings , but also the guidance of reason . What position wilderness should enjoy in the preservation of the world obviously deserves much more serious thinking .",

    "passage": "Before I came to China , I had heard that , although North Americans eat more than Chinese , Chinese eat better . Since I have come to China , I have been able to experience these differences first - hand . A whole new world of food has been opened up to me . Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals associated with eating . For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody 's teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we do n't like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening 's meal . I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty . The meal was winding its way along without any problems . Then they brought out the lobster . I looked at it and then looked at it again and noticed that it was still moving ! It had been brought out live to show that our raw lobster was indeed very fresh . At that point , I nearly lost it . It took all my composure for me to stay seated at the table and hurl myself in the bathroom and bring up the contents of the previous dishes . Now the interesting thing is that when I tell that story to a foreigner , the reaction is always the same : Horror , sympathy , shock . When I tell the same story to Chinese , they do n't understand my point of view . In fact , I often think that they believe that there is something truly wrong with me and not with the fact a lobster had been served live at the table .",
