The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle . In the study , the researchers let volunteers read , play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring how much light their eyes received . They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22 % . Studies of students using computers at night have got the similar results . And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness , but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes and other diseases .

    "passage": "To understand why the Earth is warming up , first of all , we need to understand why it is warm . Our planet is covered with atmosphere . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth . The Sun heats up the Earth 's surface . When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming can not be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth . The Sun heats up the Earth 's surface . When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming can not be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

Some adults think it would probably never happen to them , so they do n't teach their children what to do . Before it 's too late , here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster : Educate : It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters . This does n't mean children have to live in fear . When teaching them about disasters , keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster . Keep the conversations short , allow for questions and answer honestly . Prepare : Always be prepared , that is the best advice for children . For example , when preparing for bad weather , get the tools you need , like candles , radios , food , water and medicine . Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them , if ever needed . Plan : You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation . Write out a simple list that they can read . The plan could start with \" listen to an adult 's advice and/or call 119 \" . Practice : Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan , practice every few months . Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes . Disasters ca n't be avoided but they can be lessened once you are prepared and ready for one .",

This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior , the head of the church , who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems , the more he accomplishes ; and so he tried to find fault with the idle painter . Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation ; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest . Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture : that of Christ , for which no model on earth could be found , for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength , and beauty , and tenderness , and deep sorrow of the Christ ; then he also needed a head of Judas , and that was hard to find as well , for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor .

    "passage": "Much of the water we use comes from snow . Melting snow provides water for rivers , electric power centers and agricultural crops . In the western United States , mountain snow provides up to 75 % of all surface water supplies . Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold , winter weather . Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving , the movement of heat is greatly reduced . Snow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves . When there is fresh snow on the ground , the surface of the snow takes in , or absorbs , sound waves . However , snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds . Then the snow 's surface will help to send back sound waves . Under these conditions , sounds may seem clearer and travel farther . Generally , the color of snow and ice appears white . This is because the light we see from the sun is white . Most natural materials take in some sunlight . This gives them their color . However , when light travels from air to snow , some light is sent back , or reflected . Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight . Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight . It is this light that gives snow its white appearance . Sometimes , snow or ice may appear to be blue . The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice . In simple terms , think of snow or ice as a filter . A filter is designed to reject some substances , while permitting others to pass through . In the case of snow , all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick . If it is a meter or more thick , however , blue light often can be seen .",

    "passage": "Nowadays , more and more people prefer to travel by plane . They think air travel is far safer than driving a car on a busy motorway . But still there is a danger that grows every year . Airliners get larger and larger . Some airplanes can carry over 300 passengers . And the air itself becomes more and more crowded . If one large airliner struck into another in mid - air , 600 lives could be lost . From the moment an airliner takes off to the moment it lands , every movement is watched on radar screens . Air traffic controllers tell the pilot exactly when to turn , when to climb , and when to come down . The air traffic controllers around a busy airport like London - Heathrow may deal with 2,500 planes a day . Not all of them actually land at the airport . Any plane that flies near the airport comes under the orders of the controllers there . Even a small mistake on their part could cause a terrible accident . Recently such a disaster almost happened . Two large jets were flying towards the airport . One was carrying 69 passengers from Toronto , the other 176 passengers from Chicago . An air traffic controller noticed on his radar screen that the two planes were too close to each other . He ordered one to turn to the right and to climb . But he made a mistake . He ordered the wrong plane to do this . So , instead of turning away from the second plane , the first plane turned towards it . Fifteen seconds later it flew directly in front of the second plane . They avoided each other by the smallest part of a second . The distance between them was less than that of a large swimming pool . This is an example of the danger that grows every year .",

Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting , the monks in the church annoyed at the delay . It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals . But at other times he spent hours before the picture , lost in contemplation , examining , comparing , and measuring his figures . This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior , the head of the church , who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems , the more he accomplishes ; and so he tried to find fault with the idle painter . Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation ; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest . Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture : that of Christ , for which no model on earth could be found , for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength , and beauty , and tenderness , and deep sorrow of the Christ ; then he also needed a head of Judas , and that was hard to find as well , for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor .

    "passage": "Much of the water we use comes from snow . Melting snow provides water for rivers , electric power centers and agricultural crops . In the western United States , mountain snow provides up to 75 % of all surface water supplies . Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold , winter weather . Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving , the movement of heat is greatly reduced . Snow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves . When there is fresh snow on the ground , the surface of the snow takes in , or absorbs , sound waves . However , snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds . Then the snow 's surface will help to send back sound waves . Under these conditions , sounds may seem clearer and travel farther . Generally , the color of snow and ice appears white . This is because the light we see from the sun is white . Most natural materials take in some sunlight . This gives them their color . However , when light travels from air to snow , some light is sent back , or reflected . Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight . Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight . It is this light that gives snow its white appearance . Sometimes , snow or ice may appear to be blue . The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice . In simple terms , think of snow or ice as a filter . A filter is designed to reject some substances , while permitting others to pass through . In the case of snow , all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick . If it is a meter or more thick , however , blue light often can be seen .",

    "passage": "Wilderness \" In wilderness is the preservation of the world . \" This is a famous saying from a writer regarded as one of the fathers of environmentalism . The frequency with which it is borrowed mirrors a heated debate on environmental protection : whether to place wilderness at the heart of what is to be preserved . As John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out , there is a strong appeal in images of the wild , the untouched ; more than anything else , they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly . The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong , and the danger exploitation brings to such landscapes is real . Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need -- the rainforests , for example , store carbon in vast quantities . To Mr . Sauven , these \" ecosystem services \" far outweigh the gains from exploitation . Lee Lane , a visiting fellow at the Hudson Institute , takes the opposing view . He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services , such as water conservation . But that is not , he argues , a reason to avoid all human presence , or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation . There are ever more people on the Earth , and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives , rather than merely struggle for survival . While the ways of using resources have improved , there is still a growing need for raw materials , and some wildernesses contain them in abundance . If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide , the argument goes , there is no further reason not to do so . Being untouched is not , in itself , a characteristic worth valuing above all others . I look forwards to seeing these views taken further , and to their being challenged by the other participants . One challenge that suggests itself to me is that both cases need to take on the question of spiritual value a little more directly . And there is a practical question as to whether wildernesses can be exploited without harm . This is a topic that calls for not only free expression of feelings , but also the guidance of reason . What position wilderness should enjoy in the preservation of the world obviously deserves much more serious thinking .",

As John Sauven of Greenpeace UK points out , there is a strong appeal in images of the wild , the untouched ; more than anything else , they speak of the nature that many people value most dearly . The urge to leave the subject of such images untouched is strong , and the danger exploitation brings to such landscapes is real . Some of these wildernesses also perform functions that humans need -- the rainforests , for example , store carbon in vast quantities . To Mr .

He acknowledges that wildernesses do provide useful services , such as water conservation . But that is not , he argues , a reason to avoid all human presence , or indeed commercial and industrial exploitation . There are ever more people on the Earth , and they reasonably and rightfully want to have better lives , rather than merely struggle for survival . While the ways of using resources have improved , there is still a growing need for raw materials , and some wildernesses contain them in abundance . If they can be tapped without reducing the services those wildernesses provide , the argument goes , there is no further reason not to do so . Being untouched is not , in itself , a characteristic worth valuing above all others . I look forwards to seeing these views taken further , and to their being challenged by the other participants .

He said:\"I took Latin and Greek in high school and got A 's and I guess it helps my vocabulary . I keep hoping to get time to study one of these -- probably French because it is the easiest . I did Duolingo for a while but did n't keep it up . \" Gates , who is worth $ 79.3 billion , praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for surprising an audience in Beijing when he spoke fluent Chinese.\"Mark Zuckerberg amazingly leamed Chinese and did a Q&A with Chinese students -- unbelievable , isn't it?\"he said . This is n't the first time for Gates to admit his regret over language . He also showed his habits at home and personal insights . Last February , Gates said he likes to do the dishes himself -- to his own special standards every night and also told the interviewer that his wife , Melinda , would likely want Samuel L.Jackson to play her husband in a biopic .

It 's the only one that can never be true . Today , if a bank statement cheats you out of $ 900 that way , you know what the clerk is sure to say : \" It was a computer error . \" Nonsense . The computer is reporting nothing more than what the clerk typed into it . The most annoying case of all is when the computerized cash register in the grocery store shows that an item costs more than it actually does . If the innocent buyer points out the mistake , the checker , bagger and manager all come together and offer the familiar explanation : \" It was a computer error . \" It was n't , of course . That high - tech cash register is really nothing more than an electric eye . The eye reads the Universal Product Code -- that ribbon of black and white lines on the package --and then checks the code against a price list stored in memory . If the price list is right , you 'll be charged accurately . Grocery stores update the price list each day -- that is , somebody sits at a keyboard and types in the prices . If the price they type in is too high , there are only two explanations : carelessness or dishonesty . But somehow \" a computer error \" is supposed to excuse everything . One reason we let people hide behind a computer is the common misunderstanding that huge , modern computers are \" electric brains \" with \" artificial intelligence . \" At some point there might be a machine with intelligence , but none exists today .

Henry had to spend all his time flat on his back . The men talked for hours , of their wives , families , their homes and their jobs . And every afternoon when Alan , in the bed next to the window , could sit up , he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see . Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats . Lovers walked arm in arm among flowers . Trees and skyline could be seen in the distance . As he described all this , Henry , on the other side of the room , would close his eyes and imagine the scene . One warm afternoon Alan described a parade passing by . Although Henry could not hear the band , he could see it in his mind . Unexpectedly , an _ though : entered his head : why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything while I never got to see anything ? It does n't seem fair . Henry felt ashamed at first . But as the days passed and he missed seeing more sight , his envy grew and soon let him down . He began to find himself unable to sleep . He should be by that window ---- and that thought now controlled his life . Late one night , as he lay staring at the ceiling . Alan began to cough . He was choking . Henry watched in the dim room as the struggling man tried hard to reach for the button to call for help . Listening from across the room , he never moved , never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running . In less than five minutes , the coughing and choking stopped , along with the sound of breathing . Now , there was only silence ---- deathly silence . As soon as it seemed appropriate , Henry asked if he could be moved next to the window . The nurse was happy to make the switch and after making sure he was comfortable , she left him alone . Slowly , painfully , he struggled to take his first look . Finally , he would have the joy of seeing it all himself . He looked out , but faced a black wall .",

    "passage": "Before I came to China , I had heard that , although North Americans eat more than Chinese , Chinese eat better . Since I have come to China , I have been able to experience these differences first - hand . A whole new world of food has been opened up to me . Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals associated with eating . For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody 's teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we do n't like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening 's meal . I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty . The meal was winding its way along without any problems . Then they brought out the lobster . I looked at it and then looked at it again and noticed that it was still moving ! It had been brought out live to show that our raw lobster was indeed very fresh . At that point , I nearly lost it . It took all my composure for me to stay seated at the table and hurl myself in the bathroom and bring up the contents of the previous dishes . Now the interesting thing is that when I tell that story to a foreigner , the reaction is always the same : Horror , sympathy , shock . When I tell the same story to Chinese , they do n't understand my point of view . In fact , I often think that they believe that there is something truly wrong with me and not with the fact a lobster had been served live at the table .",
