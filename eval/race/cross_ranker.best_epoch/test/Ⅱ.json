What the scientists input is sent by telephone lines to the computer , and after a time , copies of the designs are needed back in Felton as possible . Lockheed people have tried several ways of sending the prints , but the most effective seems to be by pigeon . Are pigeons really used to carry messages in these days ? They are , and they send the prints faster and cheaper than any other way . Human messengers ( persons carrying messages ) are much more expensive and slower than the pigeons . The road to Felton goes through the mountains , and the driving is not easy . An electronic printout system could do the work in Felton , but at a cost of 10 dollars a print . Pigeons carry the designs for about 1 dollar each . Now Lockheed people have ten pigeon messengers . The pigeons do the work , and they have made Lockheed more famous . You can often read the news about the pigeons in the newspapers around the world .",

Fire is one of man 's greatest friends , but also one of his greatest enemies . Many big fires are caused by carelessness . A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire . Sometimes , though , a fire can start on its own . Wet hay can begin burning by itself . This is how it happens : the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it . Finally , it bursts into flames . That 's why farmers cut and store their hay when it 's dry . Fires have destroyed whole cities . In the 17th century , a small fire which began in a baker 's shop burnt down nearly every building in London . Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon . This fire continued burning for seven days . And , of course , in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome .

Fire is one of man 's greatest friends , but also one of his greatest enemies . Many big fires are caused by carelessness . A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire . Sometimes , though , a fire can start on its own . Wet hay can begin burning by itself . This is how it happens : the hay starts to rot and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it . Finally , it bursts into flames . That 's why farmers cut and store their hay when it 's dry . Fires have destroyed whole cities . In the 17th century , a small fire which began in a baker 's shop burnt down nearly every building in London . Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon . This fire continued burning for seven days . And , of course , in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome .

Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food .

Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda . Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper , using the baking soda solution as \" ink \" . Allow the ink to dry . One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source , such as a light bulb . The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown . The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice . The message will appear in a different color1 . Tips : If you are using the heating method , avoid burning the paper . Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid - base reaction , producing a color1 change in the paper .

Use a small plate that may encourage you to \" load up \" . You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist . Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables . Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food .

With proper planning , though , it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays . The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much . You do n't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy . Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness : Do n't skip meals . Before you leave home , have a small , low - fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods . Control the amount of food . Use a small plate that may encourage you to \" load up \" . You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist . Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables . Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food .

    "passage": "Do you love holidays but hate gaining weight ? You are not alone . Holidays are times for celebrating . Many people are worried about their weight . With proper planning , though , it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays . The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much . You do n't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy . Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness : Do n't skip meals . Before you leave home , have a small , low - fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods . Control the amount of food . Use a small plate that may encourage you to \" load up \" . You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist . Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables . Fill up beforehand on water - based soup and raw fruit or vegetables , or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full . Avoid high - fat foods . Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat . Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables . Use lemon juice instead of creamy food . Stick to physical activity . Do n't let exercise take a break during the holidays . A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories.(238 words )",

Salaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part . It depends on their salaries . The federal government has a two - level income tax : that is,15 or 28 percent.$17 850 is the cut off . The tax rate is 15 percent below $ 17 850 and 28 percent above . The second tax is for the state government : New York , California , or any of the other forty - eight states . Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government . Of course , the percentage for the state tax is lower . Other states have a sales tax , which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state . Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues(=annual income ) . The third tax is for the city . This tax comes in two forms : property tax(people who own a home have to pay taxes on it ) and excise tax , which is collected on vehicles in a city . The cities use this money for education , police , public works , etc . Since Americans pay such high taxes , they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes .

Rudolf Trabold , a spokesman for the museum , said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone . People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

In 1044 , Song Dynasty , Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun , the ancient name of Yueyang City . In the second year , he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower . Fan Zhongyan , a great artist and poet , was invited to write the well - known poem about Yueyang Tower . In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower ( < < > > ) , Fan writes : \" Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land , the last to enjoy universal happiness . \" His words have been well - known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before . The style of Yueyang Tower is quite special . The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories , flying eave and wood construction , the helmet - roof of such a large size is a rarity among the ancient architectures in China . Entering the tower , you 'll see \" Dongting is the water of the world , Yueyang is the tower of the world \" . Moving on , there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three - Kingdom Period general Lu Su . To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion in honor of Du Fu .

    "passage": "For years we have been dieting strictly after the year - end overeating , afraid that when summer . comes , the bigger size we have accumulated will betray how we ate . Now scientists say , it 's a little bug that causes obesity . As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives , millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures . But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates , but some bacteria in your guts . Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity . A research team led by Zhao Liping , a professor in Shanghai , has identified a precise link between a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain . \" The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat . And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat , \" Zhao says . Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut , microbiota , may play a very important role in weight gain , but they had never been able to prove it . In 2004 , American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice . While a link was believed to exist , proving it was another matter . \" The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing , \" says Lita Proctor , director of the US National Institutes of Health . \" But the problem is that we 're only able to look at associations and are n't yet able to conduct cause - and - effect studies . \" In the clinical study , researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin - producing bacteria , leading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria , in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg . Based on this information , researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts . After 23 weeks , the patient lost 51.4 kg , with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared .",

These three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes , and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err , or to make mistakes , is indeed a part of being human , but it seems that most people do n't want to accept the responsibility for the problem . Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this : \" To err is human , to forgive , divine .\"This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others ' mistakes . Instead , we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to . However , taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity . Common sense is what we call clear thought . Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well , and it also means staying with the plan . Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm , but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine . Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations , because there are so many things going on that one person can not be in charge of everything . People say that in a large company , \" the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing . \" And what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art ? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people , especially young people , get the idea that it 's okay not to be totally honest all the time . There is a corollary to that : if good excuse is \" good \" even if it is n't honest , then where is the place of the truth ?",

    "passage": "Americans often say that there are only two things a person can be sure of : death and taxes . Many people feel that the United States has the worst taxes in the world . Taxes are the money that people pay to support their government . There are generally three levels of government in the United States : federal , state , and city;therefore , there are three types of taxes . Salaried people who can earn more than four to five thousand dollars per year must pay a certain part . It depends on their salaries . The federal government has a two - level income tax : that is,15 or 28 percent.$17 850 is the cut off . The tax rate is 15 percent below $ 17 850 and 28 percent above . The second tax is for the state government : New York , California , or any of the other forty - eight states . Some states have an income tax similar to that of the federal government . Of course , the percentage for the state tax is lower . Other states have a sales tax , which is a percentage charged to any item which people buy in the state . Some states use income tax and sales tax to raise their revenues(=annual income ) . The third tax is for the city . This tax comes in two forms : property tax(people who own a home have to pay taxes on it ) and excise tax , which is collected on vehicles in a city . The cities use this money for education , police , public works , etc . Since Americans pay such high taxes , they often feel that they are working one day each week just to pay their taxes . People always complain about taxes . They often say that the government misuses their tax dollars . They all believe that taxes are too high in this country .",

    "passage": "Yueyang Tower lies in the west of Yueyang City , near the Dongting Lake . It was first built for soldiers to rest on and watch out . In the Three Kingdoms Period , Lu Su , General of Wu State , trained his soldiers here . In 716 , Kaiyuan of Tang Dynasty , General Zhang Shuo was sent to defend at Yuezhou and he rebuilt it into a tower named South Tower , and then Yueyang Tower . In 1044 , Song Dynasty , Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun , the ancient name of Yueyang City . In the second year , he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower . Fan Zhongyan , a great artist and poet , was invited to write the well - known poem about Yueyang Tower . In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower ( < < > > ) , Fan writes : \" Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land , the last to enjoy universal happiness . \" His words have been well - known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before . The style of Yueyang Tower is quite special . The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories , flying eave and wood construction , the helmet - roof of such a large size is a rarity among the ancient architectures in China . Entering the tower , you 'll see \" Dongting is the water of the world , Yueyang is the tower of the world \" . Moving on , there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three - Kingdom Period general Lu Su . To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion in honor of Du Fu . Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door , the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides . In the garden to the north of the tower is the tomb of Xiaoqiao , the wife of Zhou Yu .",

    "passage": "\" Hitler and the Germans , \" an exhibition in Berlin 's German Historical Museum which aims to investigate the society that created Hitler , has seen more than 10,000 visitors walk through its doors since opening on Friday . Rudolf Trabold , a spokesman for the museum , said there were 4,000 visitors to the exhibition on the first day alone . People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in . Ravi Nair , a 73-year - old Indian visitor , said : \" I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it . The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable . \" Trabold said \" Hitler and the Germans \" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years , in Vienna 's men 's hostels , could become an almost mythical leader of the German people . \" We are all affected by Hitler , so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past . \" Inge Lonning , a 72-year - old tourist from Norway said : \" I thought the exhibition was very impressive . I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child , so it 's not just history for me . \" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition . \" So much has been done about this period over the years , it was like , I knew this and I knew that , \" said Canadian Julien Cayer , aged 28 . \" I thought I 'd find something new but I did n't . \" There has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo - Nazi admirers of Hitler , but Trabold said that although there had been some right - wing extremist visitors , they had not caused any problems .",

Now scientists say , it 's a little bug that causes obesity . As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives , millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures . But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas turkey or hot chocolates , but some bacteria in your guts . Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity . A research team led by Zhao Liping , a professor in Shanghai , has identified a precise link between a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain . \" The endotoxin released by the bacterium can activate a gene that helps produce fat . And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat , \" Zhao says . Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut , microbiota , may play a very important role in weight gain , but they had never been able to prove it . In 2004 , American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice . While a link was believed to exist , proving it was another matter . \" The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing , \" says Lita Proctor , director of the US National Institutes of Health . \" But the problem is that we 're only able to look at associations and are n't yet able to conduct cause - and - effect studies . \" In the clinical study , researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin - producing bacteria , leading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria , in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg . Based on this information , researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized nutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts . After 23 weeks , the patient lost 51.4 kg , with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared .",

You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings . How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone ? You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person . Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad , angry , scared , or worried . Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship . In unhealthy relationships , there is an unfair balance . You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you . You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets . In a healthy relationship , you like to spend time with the other person , instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her .",

    "passage": "\" What is the most important thing you 've done in your life ? \" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers . The answer came to me in an instant . It 's not the one I gave , because the situation was not right . As a lawyer in the entertainment industry , I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well - known people , but here 's the true answer : The most important thing I 've ever done occurred on October 8,1990 . I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I had n't seen for a while . Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other 's lives . He and his wife had just had a baby boy , who was keeping them up at night . While we were playing , a car came screaming up the road toward the courts . It was my friend 's father , who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital . In a flash my friend was in the car and gone , disappearing in a cloud of dust . For a moment I just stood there , paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do . Follow my friend to the hospital ? There was nothing I could accomplish there , I convinced myself . My friend 's son was in the care of doctors and nurses , and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome . Be there for moral support ? Well , maybe . But my friend and his wife both had large families , and I knew they 'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support , whatever happened . All I could do at the hospital , I decided , was to get in the way . Also , I had planned a full day with my family , who were waiting for me to get home . So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later . As I started my car , I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts . I now faced another problem . I could n't leave the keys in the truck . So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys . When I arrived , I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting . As I had thought , the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife . I went in and stood by the door , trying to decide what to do next . Soon a doctor appeared . He approached my friend and his wife , and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died . For a long time the two held each other and cried , unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence . After they had calmed themselves , the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son . My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families . When they reached the door , my friend saw me standing in the corner . He came over and hugged me and started to cry . My friend 's wife hugged me , too , and said , \" Thanks for being here . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . It 's the most important thing I have ever done . The experience taught me two lessons . First : The most important thing I 've ever done happened when I was completely helpless . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Something terrible was happening to people I cared about , and I was powerless to change the outcome . All I could do was standing by and watching it happen . And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me . Second : The most important thing I 've done almost did n't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . These skills are critical for lawyers . When people come to us for help , they 're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically . But while learning to think , I almost forget how to feel . Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life is n't the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",

My friend 's wife hugged me , too , and said , \" Thanks for being here . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . It 's the most important thing I have ever done . The experience taught me two lessons . First : The most important thing I 've ever done happened when I was completely helpless . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Something terrible was happening to people I cared about , and I was powerless to change the outcome . All I could do was standing by and watching it happen . And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me . Second : The most important thing I 've done almost did n't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . These skills are critical for lawyers . When people come to us for help , they 're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically . But while learning to think , I almost forget how to feel . Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life is n't the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",
