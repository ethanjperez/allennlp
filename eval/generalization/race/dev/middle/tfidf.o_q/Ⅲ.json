Here are some useful communication strategies for you to use . State your feelings clearly but don ' t criticize them . Begin with \" I feel \" instead of \" You always . . . \" . Don ' t stop or finish the other person ' s sentences . Listen carefully to what the other person is saying . Try to see the other person ' s side of the disagreement .

In 1997 , the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world . Now , the 3 - D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10 . As anyone who has seen the movie knows , the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on its first _ in 1912 , killing 1 , 517 people . A century after the accident , scientists have found something new to blame for the sinking : the moon . Donald Olson , a Texas State University physicist , led a team of astronomers to examine the moon ' s role , according to Reuters . Normally , icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide frees them . A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward .

But I was wrong . This trip was the best holiday I have ever had . During the holiday , I met a very special friend . While I was walking in the countryside , I saw a man carrying a small brown bag . Wearing white clothes , the man looked like a ghost . As he looked at me , I felt frightened . I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me . \" Hello . Beautiful day , isn ' t it ? \" he said . The man talked a lot . I wasn ' t listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag . I wanted to see what was inside it ! He saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see . Out came a lively , beautiful puppy . The brown puppy was small and only about two months old . The man then asked me , \" Would you like to keep this puppy ? \" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance . I thanked him , took the puppy and ran home .

The policemen give them pieces of paper which people call traffic tickets . Traffic tickets tell the drivers how much money they must pay .

When I got home , the lights were on but it was very quiet . I called to my wife but there was no answer . Then I remembered that she was out at a concert . I was still very upset about what happened on the road , so I made myself a drink . Then I went upstairs to have a bath . I saw that the window in the bedroom was open . This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out . She was afraid of burglars . When I went to close it , I found Ellen . She was lying on the floor . There was blood everywhere . I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead . I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything .

He loved to look at the world around him . When he went to college in Paris , he showed interest in looking through a microscope . A microscope makes things look a lot bigger ; it lets you see things you can ' t see just with your eyes . Looking through a microscope , Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water . He saw and drew pictures of the small living things - - he called them \" microbes \" or \" germs \" - - that crowded in a drop of water . One day a winemaker came into the lab , hoping that someone could help him with his problem . \" Sometimes my wine tastes delicious , but sometimes terrible , \" he said to Pasteur . \" Can you help me find out why ? \" Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope . He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs . If he killed these germs , maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible . He tried with different ways to kill the germs . In the end he found heating the wine seemed to work best . The winemaker tried it , and every bottle of wine tasted good . Pasteur ' s idea worked for other people , too .

When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

A camera in the mirror , using Microsoft Kinect , monitors a customer ' s movement and projects a 3 - D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen . The room also uses augmented reality technology . \" Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically , \" the company told the Daily Mail . A customer can spin around to see all angles of the clothes , and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons . AR Door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look . Japanese company Shiseido recently presented its Magic Mirror , a virtual make - up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds . However , the technology is not perfect . The clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body , rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them . And people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on . In the end , you won ' t know how something really looks and feels .", "question": "In the virtual fitting room, what is on the screen?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["If you have , here ' s the device for you : the virtual fitting room .", "When a customer walks into a \" fitting \" room , they ' ll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror .", "A camera in the mirror , using Microsoft Kinect , monitors a customer ' s movement and projects a 3 - D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen .", "A customer can spin around to see all angles of the clothes , and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons .", "Japanese company Shiseido recently presented its Magic Mirror , a virtual make - up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds .", "The room also uses augmented reality technology .", "The clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body , rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them .", "However , the technology is not perfect .", "\" Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically , \" the company told the Daily Mail .", "Have you ever wanted to try on clothes without going to the trouble of getting undressed ?", "The technology , designed by Russian company AR Door , was first tried out in May .", "In the end , you won ' t know how something really looks and feels .", "AR Door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look .", "And people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on ."], "answer_index": 2, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["A computer", "A fitting room", "A camera", "A shop assistant"]}, "test/middle/401.txt/0": {"passage": "A young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers .

With so many people downloading maps , sports videos , news and restaurant recommendations , you can get digital \" traffic jams \" . Meanwhile , users are expecting faster and faster service . Google found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website , then people will visit it less often . This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest . Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same . For example , a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result . Even so , four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load . This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times . Trying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet . In the 1990s , when the World Wide Web first started to become popular , it was very crowded and slow ; people called it the \" World Wide Wait \" . But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions . They laid a lot of fiber optic cables for sending in high speed ; they improved software so it would work more smoothly ; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users ; all this increased speed . Nowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet . Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft ' s Bing usually find search results in less than a second . _ .", "question": "What can be the best title of this passage?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["With so many people downloading maps , sports videos , news and restaurant recommendations , you can get digital \" traffic jams \" .", "For example , a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result .", "This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest .", "This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times .", "Trying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet .", "Nowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet .", "They laid a lot of fiber optic cables for sending in high speed ; they improved software so it would work more smoothly ; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users ; all this increased speed .", "Half a minute ?", "A few seconds ?", "_ .", "A millisecond is one thousandth of a second .", "In the 1990s , when the World Wide Web first started to become popular , it was very crowded and slow ; people called it the \" World Wide Wait \" .", "\" Nowadays , millions of smart - phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information .", "Even so , four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load .", "How long are you willing to wait for a webpage to open before you start to lose your patience ?", "Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds - - as short as the blink of an eye - - is too long for most Internet users .", "But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions .", "People hardly notice such a small time difference , but it does cause them to stop searching , reported The New York Times .", "Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same .", "\" Every millisecond matters .", "Meanwhile , users are expecting faster and faster service .", "\" Without question , nobody likes to wait , \" said Arvind Jain , a Google engineer .", "Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft ' s Bing usually find search results in less than a second .", "Google found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website , then people will visit it less often ."], "answer_index": 0, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["Don't make me \"www.wait\".", "Search engines work faster.", "Traffic jams keep us waiting.", "The WWW becomes popular."]}, "test/middle/1155.txt/0": {"passage": "Michael and Derek are good friends , but they like to pull each other ' s leg sometimes .

Maria would gladly go to school , but her mother , now alone , needs her badly at home . Maria had to leave school because her family was so poor . For just 52 pennies a day , you can help out a child like Maria . Show her that someone will help her . Through Save the Children , you can help Maria ' s mother get better crops from their farm , and make money so that Maria can buy clothes and things for school . To help Maria most , your money is put with money from other donors , so hardworking people can help themselves to build schools and hospitals , bring in clean water and improve their farms .

People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language . Why not ? They did not grow up \" speaking \" it . How will millennials change the workforce ? To answer that question , it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet . They use the Internet to communicate . They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day .

It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers . \" But some experts have a different opinion . Liu Yaoying , a professor at the Communications University of China , said the move shows cultural conservatism . \" If Western countries can accept some Chinglish words , why can ' t the Chinese language be mixed with English ? \" Liu said .

Day after day , he shuttled back and forth across the village . For him , life was without waves . One day , he was delivering mail as usual . When he looked up in the sky , he suddenly lost his balance . It was a little stone that tripped him up . He observed the stone that had embarrassed him , finding it strange but beautiful . In his eyes , this stone was like a lost jewel covered with dust . The postman then placed the stone in his bag carefully . Because of this stone ' s arrival , his day was lightened . He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones . How magnificent it will be ! His ordinary life started to be different since then . He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way . All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds . Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them . People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones . After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle . During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream . No one was willing to join in . But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle . Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him .

All the students studied the same subjects , and everyone learned Latin and Greek . Little was known about science . And few people knew that one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world . When the students graduated , most of them became ministers or teachers . In 1782 , Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors . Later , lawyers could study in Harvard ' s law school . In 1825 , besides Latin and Greek , Harvard began to teach modern languages , such as French and German . Soon it began to teach American history .
