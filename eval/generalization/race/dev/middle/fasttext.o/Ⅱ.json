Here are some useful communication strategies for you to use . State your feelings clearly but don ' t criticize them . Begin with \" I feel \" instead of \" You always . . . \" . Don ' t stop or finish the other person ' s sentences . Listen carefully to what the other person is saying . Try to see the other person ' s side of the disagreement .

In 1997 , the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world . Now , the 3 - D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10 . As anyone who has seen the movie knows , the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on its first _ in 1912 , killing 1 , 517 people . A century after the accident , scientists have found something new to blame for the sinking : the moon . Donald Olson , a Texas State University physicist , led a team of astronomers to examine the moon ' s role , according to Reuters . Normally , icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide frees them . A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward .

For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate . They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds . The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red . Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April . Another person might see different colours while listening to music . Some people also taste colours . To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow . Some people experience feelings in colour . For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange . Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes . Some people see music as squares and circles . Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball . There are other forms of synesthesia , as well . For one man , different words have different tastes . Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs . Synesthesia is not a common condition . Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it . For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "question": "What is this passage mainly about?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2161"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Some people also taste colours .", "Some people experience feelings in colour .", "Another person might see different colours while listening to music .", "One person says her name is the colour red .", "They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds .", "For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange .", "Some people see music as squares and circles .", "These people have a condition called synesthesia .", "For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow .", "The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red .", "Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs .", "Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April .", "For one man , different words have different tastes .", "These questions might sound strange to most people , but some can answer right away .", "There are other forms of synesthesia , as well .", "Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball .", "For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate .", "What colour is your name ?", "What colour is Wednesday ?", "For another person , Wednesday is blue .", "Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes .", "Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it .", "This means they experience two senses at the same time .", "Synesthesia is not a common condition ."], "answer_index": 0, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["An unusual condition.", "People who like colour.", "The colour of pain.", "Music and art."]}, "test/middle/5785.txt/1": {"passage": "What colour is your name ?

But I was wrong . This trip was the best holiday I have ever had . During the holiday , I met a very special friend . While I was walking in the countryside , I saw a man carrying a small brown bag . Wearing white clothes , the man looked like a ghost . As he looked at me , I felt frightened . I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me . \" Hello . Beautiful day , isn ' t it ? \" he said . The man talked a lot . I wasn ' t listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag . I wanted to see what was inside it ! He saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see . Out came a lively , beautiful puppy . The brown puppy was small and only about two months old . The man then asked me , \" Would you like to keep this puppy ? \" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance . I thanked him , took the puppy and ran home .

The policemen give them pieces of paper which people call traffic tickets . Traffic tickets tell the drivers how much money they must pay .

I was still very upset about what happened on the road , so I made myself a drink . Then I went upstairs to have a bath . I saw that the window in the bedroom was open . This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out . She was afraid of burglars . When I went to close it , I found Ellen . She was lying on the floor . There was blood everywhere . I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead . I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything .

He loved to look at the world around him . When he went to college in Paris , he showed interest in looking through a microscope . A microscope makes things look a lot bigger ; it lets you see things you can ' t see just with your eyes . Looking through a microscope , Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water . He saw and drew pictures of the small living things - - he called them \" microbes \" or \" germs \" - - that crowded in a drop of water . One day a winemaker came into the lab , hoping that someone could help him with his problem . \" Sometimes my wine tastes delicious , but sometimes terrible , \" he said to Pasteur . \" Can you help me find out why ? \" Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope . He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs . If he killed these germs , maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible . He tried with different ways to kill the germs . In the end he found heating the wine seemed to work best . The winemaker tried it , and every bottle of wine tasted good . Pasteur ' s idea worked for other people , too .

Our planet is covered with atmosphere . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth . The Sun heats up the Earth ' s surface . When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

willing to wait for a webpage to open before you start to lose your patience ? Half a minute ? A few seconds ? Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds - - as short as the blink of an eye - - is too long for most Internet users . A millisecond is one thousandth of a second . People hardly notice such a small time difference , but it does cause them to stop searching , reported The New York Times . \" Without question , nobody likes to wait , \" said Arvind Jain , a Google engineer . \" Every millisecond matters . \" Nowadays , millions of smart - phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information . With so many people downloading maps , sports videos , news and restaurant recommendations , you can get digital \" traffic jams \" . Meanwhile , users are expecting faster and faster service . Google found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website , then people will visit it less often . This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest . Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same . For example , a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result . Even so , four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load . This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times . Trying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet . In the 1990s , when the World Wide Web first started to become popular , it was very crowded and slow ; people called it the \" World Wide Wait \" . But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions .

Is it because the spices make the food taste better ? Is it just because their parents and grandparents and great - grandparents liked hot food , or is there any connection between spices and healthy food ? Scientists think that it is because spice plants have some important chemicals . These chemicals can kill bacteria . \" Most common spices can kill 75 to 100 percent of the bacteria in food , \" explains one of the scientists . The bacteria grow more easily and spoil ( . . . ) food more quickly at higher temperatures . For this reason , it is more difficult to keep food from spoiling in hot climates , Do you like your food spicy ? Your answer probably tells something about the country you are from .

Even in the busy summer period the organization that provides the homestays will always try to place you with the most suitable host family to meet your needs .

If you answer is \" no , \" then you are probably a millennial . Millennials are the new generation of young Americans . They were born between 1982 and 1992 . There are 33 million of them , and they are just starting to enter the workforce . Many experts believe that millennials are different from young Americans of past generations . They also believe that millenials will change the workforce in important ways . How are millennials different ? They are the first generation born in the computer age . The internet has always been a part of their lives . They spend about 16 hours a week on the Internet , and this doesn ' t include e - mail . And they spend 72 hours a week using other electronic media , including mobile phones and video games . They are \" nation speakers \" of the language of the computer age . People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language . Why not ? They did not grow up \" speaking \" it . How will millennials change the workforce ? To answer that question , it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet . They use the Internet to communicate . They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day . They share ideas , music , information , games , and friendships with people all over the world . When they start working , they will want to share their work and ideas with others . It is also important to understand the way millennials grew up . Thair parents and teachers gave them a lot of attention . They taught them that their opinions were valuable . As a result , amny millennials are very cinfident . At work , they will expect their co - workers and bosses to listen to their opinions . Millennials also grew up with a lot of structure in their lives . Many of them went to school from the age of two or three and played on sports teams . At work , they will expect the rules to be clear . They will also expect a strong but fair boss , like a coach on a sports team . They will follow the person in charge if he or she is fair .

How do you take part in the sport if you don ' t know much about it ? Most schools offer cross - country and track programs , but there are also running clubs open to all ages . A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area . The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun . They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies . Runners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be . If you go to a race , you ' ll see people cheering for all the runners , from the first place finisher to the last place finisher . Running isn ' t always about how fast you are or how far you ' re going . It ' s about getting out there and doing it . Taking part is more important than competition , and effort is recognized over gift . If you ' re looking for more than just a sport , running may be the perfect choice for you .", "question": "What is probably the best title for this passage?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2161"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Not a problem !", "Running isn ' t always about how fast you are or how far you ' re going .", "No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training .", "Throw on some running shoes and comfortable clothes and go for a run .", "A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area .", "All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment .", "Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen intake , so you don ' t get sick easily .", "The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun .", "One of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don ' t need expensive equipment .", "But just because you don ' t need much equipment don ' t be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy .", "Running makes your heart , lungs , and muscles stronger .", "If you ' re looking for more than just a sport , running may be the perfect choice for you .", "Most schools offer cross - country and track programs , but there are also running clubs open to all ages .", "How do you take part in the sport if you don ' t know much about it ?", "If you go to a race , you ' ll see people cheering for all the runners , from the first place finisher to the last place finisher .", "Runners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be .", "It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly .", "It ' s about getting out there and doing it .", "Taking part is more important than competition , and effort is recognized over gift .", "It makes you know more about your body .", "You change the channels for the fourth time and realize that once again there ' s nothing on television that gets your attention .", "They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies ."], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["Running and Runners", "Running: Easy or Difficult", "Running and Watching TV", "Running: a Sport or a Way of Life"]}, "test/middle/2047.txt/0": {"passage": "I am a Middle School student .

It can also be physical . The behavior happens over and over again , and can take place anywhere , from the playground to the Internet . It ' s reported that nearly half of all kids will experience bullying in school , and at least 10 percent are bullied regularly . Each year in October , many people begin to pay attention to bullying and try to do something to stop it . Many schools hold anti - bullying programs . Will stronger anti - bullying laws change the behavior forever ? Ken Trump , president of the National School Safety and Security Services , says no . \" State anti - bullying laws do not provide more money , or other support , \" he said . Some people note that they had strict anti - bullying policies in place long before the law passed . \" The law will not change what we do , because we already take this matter very seriously , \" explains Bruce Winkelstein , the headmaster of Brookside School in New Jersey .

Do you use ten different words to do it ? Can you do it in English , or do you have to use your first language ? Do you count on your fingers ? Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world . But scientists have discovered that it is not true . People in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers . In the United States , people begin counting with their first finger , which they extend or stick out . They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb to count to five . Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten . In China , people count by using different finger positions . In this way , a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand .

Tom is the hero of the story , but there are another important characters . Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him .

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself ? Well , obviously it ' s because we have mirror neurons in our brains . Put simply , the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something , our brains model after it , whether or not we actually perform the same action . This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile , talk , walk , dance or play sports . But the idea goes further : mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions , they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people . Mirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains , but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages , and to understand how other people feel . Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language . A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to ( for example : \" The hand took hold of the ball \" ) , the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed ( in this example , actually taking hold of a ball ) . Any problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior . Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning . However , it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders .
