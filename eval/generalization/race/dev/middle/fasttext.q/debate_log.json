Here are some useful communication strategies for you to use . State your feelings clearly but don ' t criticize them . Begin with \" I feel \" instead of \" You always . . . \" . Don ' t stop or finish the other person ' s sentences . Listen carefully to what the other person is saying . Try to see the other person ' s side of the disagreement .

In 1997 , the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world . Now , the 3 - D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10 . As anyone who has seen the movie knows , the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on its first _ in 1912 , killing 1 , 517 people . A century after the accident , scientists have found something new to blame for the sinking : the moon . Donald Olson , a Texas State University physicist , led a team of astronomers to examine the moon ' s role , according to Reuters . Normally , icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide frees them . A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward .

For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate . They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds . The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red . Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April . Another person might see different colours while listening to music . Some people also taste colours . To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow . Some people experience feelings in colour . For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange . Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes . Some people see music as squares and circles . Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball . There are other forms of synesthesia , as well . For one man , different words have different tastes . Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs . Synesthesia is not a common condition . Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it . For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "question": "What is this passage mainly about?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["What colour is Wednesday ?", "What colour is your name ?", "These questions might sound strange to most people , but some can answer right away .", "The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red .", "This means they experience two senses at the same time .", "For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "One person says her name is the colour red .", "For another person , Wednesday is blue .", "Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April .", "Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it .", "Another person might see different colours while listening to music .", "Synesthesia is not a common condition .", "They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds .", "There are other forms of synesthesia , as well .", "Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes .", "For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange .", "These people have a condition called synesthesia .", "To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow .", "For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate .", "Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball .", "Some people experience feelings in colour .", "For one man , different words have different tastes .", "Some people see music as squares and circles .", "Some people also taste colours .", "Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs ."], "answer_index": 0, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["An unusual condition.", "People who like colour.", "The colour of pain.", "Music and art."]}, "test/middle/5785.txt/1": {"passage": "What colour is your name ?

But I was wrong . This trip was the best holiday I have ever had . During the holiday , I met a very special friend . While I was walking in the countryside , I saw a man carrying a small brown bag . Wearing white clothes , the man looked like a ghost . As he looked at me , I felt frightened . I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me . \" Hello . Beautiful day , isn ' t it ? \" he said . The man talked a lot . I wasn ' t listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag . I wanted to see what was inside it ! He saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see . Out came a lively , beautiful puppy . The brown puppy was small and only about two months old . The man then asked me , \" Would you like to keep this puppy ? \" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance . I thanked him , took the puppy and ran home .

On the highways between cities , the speedlimit is usually 55 miles per hour . When people drive faster than the speedlimit , a policeman can stop them . The policemen give them pieces of paper which people call traffic tickets . Traffic tickets tell the drivers how much money they must pay .

When I got home , the lights were on but it was very quiet . I called to my wife but there was no answer . Then I remembered that she was out at a concert . I was still very upset about what happened on the road , so I made myself a drink . Then I went upstairs to have a bath . I saw that the window in the bedroom was open . This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out . She was afraid of burglars . When I went to close it , I found Ellen . She was lying on the floor . There was blood everywhere . I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead . I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything .

He loved to look at the world around him . When he went to college in Paris , he showed interest in looking through a microscope . A microscope makes things look a lot bigger ; it lets you see things you can ' t see just with your eyes . Looking through a microscope , Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water . He saw and drew pictures of the small living things - - he called them \" microbes \" or \" germs \" - - that crowded in a drop of water . One day a winemaker came into the lab , hoping that someone could help him with his problem . \" Sometimes my wine tastes delicious , but sometimes terrible , \" he said to Pasteur . \" Can you help me find out why ? \" Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope . He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs . If he killed these germs , maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible . He tried with different ways to kill the germs .

When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

I know that you want to have your own club , but you don ' t know how to start one . Do you know what makes a club , such as an English Club or a Basketball Club , successful ? Here is some advice . * Decide what kind of club to have , and come up with a nice name . Since you are interested in music , why not start a Music Club ? A club is to bring people with common interests together . * Look for members . You can start with your friends , but it isn ' t really a club until people you don ' t know want to join . * Make rules . Get together with the members and agree on rules . Make sure that if someone breaks any rule , he or she should be _ . * Have regular meetings . For the first time , you should make sure that all the members attend .

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks ; it has taken on different meanings through the years . Today , one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true . In order to please Artemis , the goddess of the moon , the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays . A moon - shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles . They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering up into the sky , where they believed Artemis lived . The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe , where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person ' s birthday , partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits . It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one ' s prayers to the gods . Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten . Traditionally , one candle represents a year of the person ' s age . Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck . But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday .

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks ; it has taken on different meanings through the years . Today , one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true . In order to please Artemis , the goddess of the moon , the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays . A moon - shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles . They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering up into the sky , where they believed Artemis lived . The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe , where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person ' s birthday , partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits . It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one ' s prayers to the gods . Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten .

Do you use ten different words to do it ? Can you do it in English , or do you have to use your first language ? Do you count on your fingers ? Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world . But scientists have discovered that it is not true . People in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers . In the United States , people begin counting with their first finger , which they extend or stick out . They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb to count to five . Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten . In China , people count by using different finger positions . In this way , a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand .

Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St . Petersburg , Missouri . He ' s a lively and clever young boy , and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends , Huck Finn and Joe , to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days . With Huck he goes looking for treasure , with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold . My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead . He decides to go to his town funeral . He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears . Everyone is surprised to see him but they ' re also pleased to see him alive . Tom is the hero of the story , but there are another important characters . Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair , Joe is Tom ' s best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story . The theme of the story is about children growing up . It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America . Finally , it talks about freedom , social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior . Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book ? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876 , but it ' s still read and loved by people all over the world today . And although it ' s only a story . Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury , so it sounds very real .

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself ? Well , obviously it ' s because we have mirror neurons in our brains . Put simply , the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something , our brains model after it , whether or not we actually perform the same action . This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile , talk , walk , dance or play sports . But the idea goes further : mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions , they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people . Mirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains , but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages , and to understand how other people feel . Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language . A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to ( for example : \" The hand took hold of the ball \" ) , the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed ( in this example , actually taking hold of a ball ) . Any problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior . Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning . However , it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders .
