What ' s worse , he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking . He asked , \" What ' s for dinner , Mom ? \" after he had just eaten . Poor Andrew , he was only 15 ! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor . A brain scan made it clear : Andrew had a malignant brain tumor . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory . He should be operated on as soon as possible . Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor , but Andrew ' s memory was still poor . He was told he would probably never go back to school . Andrew was eager to enter a university , but it seemed that his dream wouldn ' t come true . \" Even though they told me this , I knew I wanted to go back to school , \" Andrew said . \" I wanted to get my memory back . \" Andrew began by auditing an English class at a nearby school .

Sometimes your peers influence you in a _ or unhealthy way . A friend might offer you cigarettes . Cigarettes are harmful to your health . Your friend knows that . Your friend also knows that underage smoking is against the law . Yet he or she still makes the offer . This bad influence is negative peer pressure .

He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones . How magnificent it will be ! His ordinary life started to be different since then . He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way . All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds . Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them . People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones . After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle . During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream . No one was willing to join in . But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle . Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him . After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed . It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined . It was a miracle arising from the ordinary . This is a real story . The postman ' s name is Xue Waller .

After a month at our school , she hadn ' t made any friend . One day at lunch , most tables being full , I had nowhere to sit . Valeri sat alone , book in hand . I walked over to her , \" Is that a good book ? \" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading . \" What ' s it about ? \" I asked . After seconds of silence , she looked at me , her eyes shining , \" Well , it ' s about a dragon ! This boy , Eragon , finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day . He thinks it ' s a rock ! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big . \" Two weeks later , I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show . Then a shy girl walked on stage . I recognized her immediately . Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other . She started to play . The notes formed a soft , sweet tune .

Mallard suffered from a heart trouble , great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband ' s death . It was her sister Josephine who told her , in broken sentences . Her husband ' s friend Richards was there , too . It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received , with Brently Mallard ' s name leading the list of \" killed . \" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram , and hurried to send the sad message . She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same . She wept at once , with wild abandonment , in her sister ' s arms . When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone . There stood , facing the open window , a comfortable armchair . Into this she sank , pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul . She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life . The delicious breath of rain was in the air . The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her , and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves . There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it , fearfully . What was it ? It was too hard to name . But she felt it , coming out of the sky , reaching toward her through the sounds , the smells , the color that filled the air . Now her chest rose and fell violently . She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her , and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips . She said it over and over under the breath : \" free , free , free ! \" She did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her . She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind , gentle hands folded in death ; the face that had never looked at her except with love , fixed and gray and dead . But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely . And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome . There would be no one to live for during those coming years ; she would live for herself . There would be no powerful will bending hers . And yet she had loved him - - sometimes . What did it matter ! What could love count for in the face of her realization . \" Free ! Body and soul free ! \" she kept whispering . Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole . \" Louise , open the door ! I beg ; open the door - - you will make yourself ill . \" \" Go away . I am not making myself ill . \" Her fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her , all sorts of days that would be her own . She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long . It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long . She arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister ' s begging . She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory . She held her sister ' s waist , and together they walked down the stairs . Someone was opening the front door with a key . It was Brently Mallard who entered , a little travel - stained , calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella .

Mallard suffered from a heart trouble , great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband ' s death . It was her sister Josephine who told her , in broken sentences . Her husband ' s friend Richards was there , too . It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received , with Brently Mallard ' s name leading the list of \" killed . \" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram , and hurried to send the sad message . She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same . She wept at once , with wild abandonment , in her sister ' s arms . When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone . There stood , facing the open window , a comfortable armchair . Into this she sank , pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul . She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life . The delicious breath of rain was in the air . The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her , and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves . There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it , fearfully . What was it ? It was too hard to name . But she felt it , coming out of the sky , reaching toward her through the sounds , the smells , the color that filled the air . Now her chest rose and fell violently . She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her , and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips . She said it over and over under the breath : \" free , free , free ! \" She did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her . She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind , gentle hands folded in death ; the face that had never looked at her except with love , fixed and gray and dead . But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely . And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome . There would be no one to live for during those coming years ; she would live for herself . There would be no powerful will bending hers . And yet she had loved him - - sometimes . What did it matter ! What could love count for in the face of her realization . \" Free ! Body and soul free ! \" she kept whispering . Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole . \" Louise , open the door ! I beg ; open the door - - you will make yourself ill . \" \" Go away . I am not making myself ill . \" Her fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her , all sorts of days that would be her own . She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long . It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long . She arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister ' s begging . She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory . She held her sister ' s waist , and together they walked down the stairs . Someone was opening the front door with a key . It was Brently Mallard who entered , a little travel - stained , calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella . He had been far from the scene of the accident , and did not even know there had been one .

First of all , transport should be much better . At present , our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars - - it takes months . However , by 2100 , spaceship can travel at half the speed of light . It might take us two or three days to get to Mars ! Secondly , humans need food , water and air to live . Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars . These plants will produce the food and air that we need . However , can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now . There is a problem for us to live on Mars . Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does . This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space . To prevent this , humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier . Life on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways , People will have more space . Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible . Many people believe that robot will do most of our work , so we have more time for our hobbies . There will probably be no school on Mars . Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet . They can study , do their homework and take exams in online schools .

Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day . - Do you enjoy ocean animals ? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii . There , you can teach language to dolphins . Dolphins can follow orders such as \" Bring me the large ball \" . They also understand opposites . How much more can they understand ? It will be exciting to learn about these _ animals . Another study trip goes to Washington State and follows orcas . We call orcas \" Killer Whale \" , but they ' re really dolphins - - the largest kind of dolphin . . These beautiful animals travel together in family groups . They move through the ocean with their mothers , grandmothers and great - grandmothers . Ocean pollution is chasing their lives . Earthwatch is studying how this happens . Are you interested in history ? Then Greece is the place for your adventure . Thirty - five hundred years ago a volcano exploded there , on Santorini . This explosion was more terrible than Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens . But today we know a lot about the way of life of the people from that time . There are houses , kitchens , and paintings as interesting as those in Pompei . Today teams of volunteers are learning more about people from the past . Do you want a very different vacation ? Do you want to travel far , work hard and learn a lot ?

But the words , Carl Walter spoke that day , came back to me years later , and ever since have been of great value to me . Carl Walter was my piano teacher . During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I was doing . I said three or four hours a day . \" Do you practice in long _ , an hour at a time ? \" \" I try to . \" \" Well , don ' t , \" he said loudly . \" When you grow up , time won ' t come in long stretches . Practice in minutes , whenever you can find them five or ten before school , after lunch , between household tasks . Spread the practice through the day , and piano - playing will become a part of your life . \" When I was teaching at Columbia , I wanted to write , but class periods , theme - reading , and committee meetings filled my days and evenings . For two years I got practically nothing down on paper , and my excuse was that I had no time . Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said . During the next week I conducted an experiment . Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied , I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so . To my astonishment , at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision . Later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method . Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever , in every day there were moments which could be caught and put to use . There is an important trick in this time - using principle : you must get into your work quickly . If you have but five minutes for writing , you can ' t afford to waste it in chewing your pencil . You must make your mental preparations beforehand , and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes . Fortunately , rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize . I admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes . But life can be counted on to supply interruptions . Carl Walter has had a significant influence on my life .

By the time I arrived , the charming paradise had been deserted because miners ' good luck didn ' t last . Then , I realized I was not alone after all . A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house . Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers . White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind . Still smiling , the man invited me inside . My spirit seemed to come to life again . I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor . And on little tables there were seashells , books and china vases full of flowers . A woman had made this house into a home . The joy in my heart showed on my face . The man read my thoughts . \" All her work . \" He said affectionately , \" Nothing here hasn ' t felt the touch of her hand . \" One picture on the wall was not hanging straight . He went to fix it . He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight . Then he gave it a gentle touch . \" She always does that , \" he explained , \" It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child ' s hair after she has brushed it . I don ' t know why I do it . I just do it . \" As he talked , I went to a little black - walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen . There was a sweetness and softness in the woman ' s expression . The man stared at the picture . \" Nineteen her last birthday . That was the day we married . When you see her . . . ah , just wait until you meet her ! \" \" Where is she now ? \" I asked . \" Oh , she is away visiting her parents . This is Wednesday , \" he said slowly . \" She will be back on Saturday , in the evening . \" That night , I stayed . The man told me his name was Henry . Thursday evening we had two visitors , Tom and Joe . \" We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home . Any news from her ? \" \" Oh yes , \" the man replied . \" A letter . \" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it . It was full of loving messages . While reading , he glimpsed his friends and cried out , \" Oh no , you are doing it again , Tom ! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes .

I never found enough to make a rich strike . But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau . Like Heaven on Earth , it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees . By the time I arrived , the charming paradise had been deserted because miners ' good luck didn ' t last . Then , I realized I was not alone after all . A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house . Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers . White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind . Still smiling , the man invited me inside . My spirit seemed to come to life again . I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor . And on little tables there were seashells , books and china vases full of flowers . A woman had made this house into a home . The joy in my heart showed on my face . The man read my thoughts . \" All her work . \" He said affectionately , \" Nothing here hasn ' t felt the touch of her hand . \" One picture on the wall was not hanging straight . He went to fix it . He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight . Then he gave it a gentle touch . \" She always does that , \" he explained , \" It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child ' s hair after she has brushed it . I don ' t know why I do it . I just do it . \" As he talked , I went to a little black - walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen . There was a sweetness and softness in the woman ' s expression . The man stared at the picture . \" Nineteen her last birthday . That was the day we married . When you see her . . . ah , just wait until you meet her ! \" \" Where is she now ? \" I asked . \" Oh , she is away visiting her parents . This is Wednesday , \" he said slowly . \" She will be back on Saturday , in the evening . \" That night , I stayed . The man told me his name was Henry . Thursday evening we had two visitors , Tom and Joe . \" We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home . Any news from her ? \" \" Oh yes , \" the man replied . \" A letter . \" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it . It was full of loving messages . While reading , he glimpsed his friends and cried out , \" Oh no , you are doing it again , Tom ! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes . I ' m going to tell her this time ! \" \" No , you mustn ' t do that , Henry , \" the grey - haired miner said . \" I am getting old . And any little sorrow makes me cry . Lord , we miss her so . \" Saturday finally came . I was glad to see his two friends , Tom and Joe , with guitars , coming down the road as the sun began to set . They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs . Henry ' s friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey . When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses , Tom stopped my arm . \" Drop that ! Take the other . \" he whispered . I did so . Henry was served last . He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight . His face grew paler and paler . \" Boys , \" he said , \" I am sick with fear . Help ! I want to lie down . \" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth . In a moment , those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed . They seemed to be getting ready to leave . So I said , \" Please don ' t go , gentlemen . She won ' t know me . I am a stranger . \" They glanced at each other . Then Joe said , \" She ? Poor thing , she ' s been dead nineteen years ! \" \" Dead ? \" I whispered . \" That or worse . \" he said . \" She went to see her folks half a year after she got married .

It ' s time for the arctic ground squirrel to get her underground home ready . She chooses a quiet spot , hidden from wolves and foxes . She gathers grass and fur to keep her home warm . Winter is long and cold in northern Canada . Many days , the air is colder than the air in your freezer . Plants can ' t grow , so there are no leaves or grass for animals to eat . They must find other ways to live . The arctic ground squirrel \" sleeps \" the winter away . For months the ground squirrel has been eating lots of seeds , mushrooms , and berries . Now she is fat . The extra fat will keep her alive through the winter . At last she crawls through a tunnel into the nest she has made . She curls up , wraps her tail around herself , and goes to \" sleep \" . Only she won ' t really be sleeping . She will be hibernating . The ground squirrel ' s body is usually as warm as yours . When she hibernates , her body becomes just colder than ice , but she doesn ' t freeze . In the warm season , when the ground squirrel is active , she uses most of the food she eats to make heat to stay warm . When she hibernates , she doesn ' t need much food . Her heart beats just one or two times each minute . She will take only about three breaths each minute . She won ' t move , even if someone touches her or shines a light into her eyes . These changes in the ground squirrel ' s body let her live through the winter . The ground squirrel will not stay in hibernation all winter . Her body warms up and becomes active for a few hours once every few weeks . Over the winter , these active times use up more than half of the energy that she worked so hard to store .

If you , like me , were born in the year of the pig , then you are brave , thoughtful and loyal . The year of the pig is filled with good fortune . Now let ' s take a closer look at this interesting animal . Pigs were first raised by man about 9 , 000 years ago , and are still a very common farm animal in many parts of the world . We don ' t just use pigs for their meat - - almost every part of the animal is used . The hair is used for artists ' brushes . The fat is used to make floor wax , rubber and plastics . Pigs have also been important in the world of entertainment . In 1995 the film ' Babe ' starred a loveable talking pig as its main character . The film won an Oscar and was nominated for 6 more . In England you can even go to watch pig racing . A farmer , Rob Shepherd , has been raising money for charity by holding pig races on his farm . The events have been very successful . People don ' t just want to eat pigs , it seems ! Pigs also play an important role in the English language . For example , if someone says that he will travel to the sun one day , you can say \" _ ! \" to him . Hungry ? Well then , you can \" pig out \" and eat lots of food .

People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive , but that was not right . Fairly soon she figured out what was happening . When most South Americans talk to each other face - to - face , they stand closer together than North Americans do . Martin had not readjusted to North American distances . Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction . Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture . Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors . For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space . Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs . They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers . Age also affects how people use personal space . Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five . As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space . By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances . Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space . For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them . Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side . Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females . The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States . As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex . As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace .

Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them . So why do they keep eating it ? The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people . However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all . 1 . Fast food makes you fat . A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance . In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes . You probably know this already . But here ' s something you may not know . 2 . Fast food is addictive . The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it . One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations . \" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it . 3 . Fast food is affecting your kids . According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years . Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen . Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly . Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity . 4 . Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them . One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 . 1 to 14 . 8 percent . So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ? Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly . That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad . 5 . Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy . Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options . The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax . One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium . 6 .

Now I am thirty two . I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is . It would be wonderful to see again , but a calamity can do strange things to people . It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn ' t been blind . I believe in life now . I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply , otherwise . I don ' t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes . I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left . Life , I believe , asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality . The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments , the more meaningful his own private world becomes . The adjustment is never easy . I was totally confused and afraid . But I was lucky . My parents and my teachers saw something in me - - a potential to live , you might call it - - which I didn ' t see , and they made me want to fight it out with blindness . The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself . That was basic . If I hadn ' t been able to do that , I would have collapsed and _ for the rest of my life . When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone . That is part of it . But I mean something bigger than that : an assurance that I am , despite imperfections , a real , positive person ; that somewhere in the sweeping , intricate pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit . It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance . It had to start with the simplest things . Once a man gave me an indoor baseball . I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt . \" I can ' t use this . \" I said . \" Take it with you , \" he urged me , \" and roll it around . \" The words stuck in my head . \" Roll it around ! \" By rolling the ball I could hear where it went . This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible : playing baseball . At Philadelphia ' s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball . We called it ground ball . All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them , one at a time . I had to learn my limitations .

My mind told me I was giving false encouragement . I reached the instructor ' s schedule and gave the rates , the available time and the additional information that he would need .

Slow food is an international movement . It promotes home cooking , and the use of fresh , unprocessed produce . It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food . It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses , rather than large supermarkets . The movement began in 1986 . at that time , McDonald ' s wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome ( Italy ) . Food writer Carlo Perini , along with others , was against this . So , the Slow Food Organization was born . Today , it has overt 100 , 00 members in 132 countries . And its symbol is one of the world ' s slowest moving creatures , the snail . The organization ' s website explains , \" The snail was chosen because it moves slowly , and calmly eats its way through life . \" But Slow Food isn ' t just about the food we eat . It ' s also about how we eat it . Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time , we ' ve forgotten that eating should be a social activity . They believe families should eat together and talk , rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it . In fact , research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table , they are more likely to do well in school , and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders . And there ' s more ! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement . This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives . And now , within the movement , there ' s Slow Money , Slow Travel , Slow Parenting , Slow Art and Slow Media , among many others . In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed . One of the Institute ' s slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West . She said , \" Everything worth doing in life , is worth doing slowly . \" Do you agree ?

But 20 years is also long enough for a man to grow up . It is always painful . For Andrew Agassi , maturing in the spotlight of international tennis competition was even harder . On September 3 , the American tennis player said a tearful goodbye to his 21 - year career after a third - round defeat in the US Open . The 36 - year - old tried his best , but was unable to keep up with German Benjamin Becker , _ \" The scoreboard said I lost today , but what the scoreboard doesn ' t say is what I ' ve found , \" Agassi said to the fans . \" I have found inspiration and you willed me to succeed . \" It was an emotional speech at the end of a long career . Agassi hated tennis as a teenager as much as he loves it now . His father made him play when he was a child . He got bored , and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle . He grew hair long , wore colorful clothes and spat at a judge . Over the years , he has made bad jokes during news conferences . Asked what he would say to his 17 - year - old self , Agassi answered , \" I would say , I understand you a lot more than I want to be you . \" The turning point in Agassi ' s career came in 1992 when he unexpectedly won his first Grand Slam at Wimbledon . It was the first time Agassi understood what real champions finally understand : winning is a test of courage and not just power , it ' s a marathon , not a sprint .

Children as young as five years old often give brief talks about objects they bring in to school - called \" show and tell , \" and this training is a basis for later public speaking . Even so , many native English - speaking adults are afraid to speak or give presentations in front of a large group . Speaking English in public meetings is necessary for many students and employees . The best way to improve is to practice public speaking in a friendly environment . Learners need to receive feedback about what they are doing well and about their mistakes . One group that gives members the chance to practice is Toastmasters . Toastmasters is an international organization that holds weekly meetings . At the meetings , members each give a speech and give others advice about their speeches and speaking style . Charles LeBeau is a public speaking professor and consultant . He began his career in Japan in 1982 . Currently , he teaches at two universities and at the Toshiba International Training Center . He has also written books on the subject . English language learners around the world use his book Speaking of Speech . Speaking of Speech tells about a method of teaching public speaking for non - native speakers . Mr . LeBeau says a simple approach helps English learners . \" The approach that I ' ve taken is to simplify and break it down .

I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university . Well , now we ' re ready to go ! We ' re going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things . We will go to Africa first . I can ' t wait ! Have you been there ? We leave London on 15thJuly , and we ' ll be flying toprefix = st1 / Morocco , in Northern Africa . We ' re going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert . It ' s the biggest desert in the world - about the size of The US ! I expect it will be very hot , dry and dusty _ . We ' ll be traveling by camel , with local guides , camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big , thick sleeping bags . I ' ve heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights . I ' ll bring a torch with me so that I ' ll be able to see in the dark . The whole trip will take six days . That means I ' ll have to sit on a came for almost a week - how uncomfortable ! I hope my camel likes me ! After the trip by camel , we ' ve going to travel down the River Nile . We ' ll start at Lake Victoria . A little way down the river from Victoria , the water actually gets quite rough . So , we ' ll go white - water rafting . It ' s quite dangerous , but very exciting ! We have to wear special clothing , a helmet and a life jacket , just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white - water rafting , we ' re going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya . We ' ll live with the local people in their villages , and eat and drink like they do , including cow ' s blood ! Do you think I should drink it ? Since we ' ll be walking every day for almost two weeks , I ' ll need to buy a large , strong , light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water . During the day , we ' ll walk across the land , following the footprints of big animals such as elephants , lions and giraffes . We ' ll try to get as close as possible to the animals , even though they ' re dangerous , so that I can take some really good photos . But don ' t worry about me - - our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close . I really want to see an elephant up close . Colin wants to see a giraffe . After that , we ' ll be moving on to Tanzania , where we ' re going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro . Mountain climbing can be very tiring , and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner , so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset .
