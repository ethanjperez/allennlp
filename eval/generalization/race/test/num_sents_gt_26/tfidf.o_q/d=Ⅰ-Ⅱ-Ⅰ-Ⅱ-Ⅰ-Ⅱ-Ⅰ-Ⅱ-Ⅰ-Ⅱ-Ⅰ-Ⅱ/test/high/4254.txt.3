  "article": "I was brought up in the British , _ . So , you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief at a Chinese funeral . Somehow we got through the day ' s work . The next day was the funeral . Finally , the man ' s mother , supported between two women , addressed her son in his coffin . At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion . In the UK , families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral . Afterwards , a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained by Chinese standards . This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens . I realized that it ' s the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world . It was our newspaper ' s production day . There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague .",
