  "article": "\" Ted started his trip alone . A cyclist he met asked him to speak at an environment meeting in Texas . Within a few hours , Ted was on a plane to the meeting and a big surprise . When he met Deanna at the meeting , they talked for six hours straight . She said yes , sold everything in her flat , gave her notice at work , and was on the road with Ted three weeks later . Deanna found Ted ' s timetable difficult because he got up early in the morning . On the way back to Vancouver , they stopped in Edmonton to visit Ted ' s relatives .",
