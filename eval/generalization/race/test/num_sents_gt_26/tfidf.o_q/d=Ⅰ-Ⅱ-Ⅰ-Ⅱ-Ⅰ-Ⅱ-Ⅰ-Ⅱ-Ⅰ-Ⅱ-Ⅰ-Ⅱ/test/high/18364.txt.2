  "article": "We hung out most weekends . One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible . But our friend could not afford the surgery . I told him not to worry because he might find a way somehow and everything would be all right . So I went to the hospital with him . I talked to the surgeon , asking him to do the surgery for him and promising to pay the expenses the next day ( As if I had that money ) . Now , how was I going to get that much money ? I tried selling my things but no one wanted them . Then I had to talk to my boss . As soon as I had the money I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills . Friendship may not only be found in happy moments .",
