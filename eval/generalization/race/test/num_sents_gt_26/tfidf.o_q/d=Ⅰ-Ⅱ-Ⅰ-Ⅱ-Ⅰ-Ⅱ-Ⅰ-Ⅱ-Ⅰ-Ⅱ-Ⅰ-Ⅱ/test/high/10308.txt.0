If not , keep it away and focus on something positive , practical and fruitful . Surround yourself with positive people . Remember : _ Don ' t allow your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult to yourself . Don ' t be jealous ; it ' s a heart killing disease , get rid of it as soon as possible .

Be aware , don ' t apply this to too closed relations . Remember this : Bad luck happens to everyone . Believe in your skills .",
