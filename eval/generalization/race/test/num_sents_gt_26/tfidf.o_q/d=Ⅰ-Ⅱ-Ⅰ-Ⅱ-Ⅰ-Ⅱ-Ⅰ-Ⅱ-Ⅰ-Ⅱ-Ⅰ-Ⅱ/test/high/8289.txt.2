  "article": "These kinds of activities aren ' t just good for your physical health . Try to make this a daily routine of life away from home , and you will guarantee yourself both physical and spiritual youth . Whether it is the ocean , a swimming pool , or a tree - lined lake , make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking .

Get out of the car every two hours . Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road , either getting to and from our destinations , or using the car for sightseeing . But no matter how beautiful the scenery is , great and memorable vacations don ' t happen in a car seat . Don ' t wait for tiredness or nature ' s call to get you to pull over .",
