  "article": "Bernie had saved some money and decided on a dry goods and grocery store combined . Following Marie ' s death , which Bernie felt was brought about from worrying about the store , He lost interest in everything . Mears ' getting so thin . He still had no customers to speak of , but from what he had left in the stor , he would sack a few cans to take to Julie ' s family . This gave her an idea . She suggested Bernie making a garden in the big space beside the store , which they had once thought would become a parking lot , and sell the produce really cheap in the store . They all came up and produced the best crop of vegetables Bernie had ever seen . They soon became well - known in the community for having the best prices and finest produce in town . The two of them worked hard throughout the 1930s and made a very successful business . As the economy picked up , so did sales at the store .",
