  "article": "One of the passengers was a small gray - haired man who took the bus to the center for senior citizens every morning . The next day , the old man boarded with a big smile and said in a loud voice : \" A very good morning to you all ! \" We never got to know if his name really was \" Charlie \" , but he nodded shyly and said yes . Charlie waved the flowers before he sat down on his seat . Every morning after that Charlie always brought flowers . Then , one morning , as autumn was closing in , Charlie wasn ' t waiting at his usual stop . When we came nearer to the center for senior citizens , one of the passengers asked the driver to wait . The old gentle man was fine , but one of his close friends had died over the weekend .",
