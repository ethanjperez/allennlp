  "article": "He ' d been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road . The truck ' s bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact , but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van . He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire . But Ronnie ' s legs were still burning , so Steve laid him on the ground , ripped off his own shirt , and beat the flames with it . In February , the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver . It was his decision to drive off the road .",
