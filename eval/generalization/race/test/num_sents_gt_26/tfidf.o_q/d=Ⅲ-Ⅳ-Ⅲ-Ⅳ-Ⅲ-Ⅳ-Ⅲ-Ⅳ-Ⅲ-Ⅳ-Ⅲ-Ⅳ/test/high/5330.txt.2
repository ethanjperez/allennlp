    "Why do the critics criticize advertisers?"

  "article": "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they ' re always getting criticism . Their critics seem to resent ( . ) them because they have a gift for self - promotion and because they have so much money to throw around . Why don ' t they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods ? He ' d have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn ' t create mass markets for products . Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine , it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance , price , etc . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers . Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price !",
