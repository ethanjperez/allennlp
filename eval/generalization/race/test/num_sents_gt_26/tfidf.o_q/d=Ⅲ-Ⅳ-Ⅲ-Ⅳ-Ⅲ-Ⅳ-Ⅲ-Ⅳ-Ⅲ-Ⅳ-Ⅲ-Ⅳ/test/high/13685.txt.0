  "article": "Last week , I bought an alarm system for about $ 450 . Now I must explain how the alarm works : 1 . Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work . That might I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house . \" There must be a burglar in the house , \" Mary said . I locked it , re - set the alarm and went back to bed . About an hour later , the alarm started again . \" That ' s our burglar . I guessed that the alarm had been made in Europe , where there are no house lizards . Well , I won ' t finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge , let me know .
