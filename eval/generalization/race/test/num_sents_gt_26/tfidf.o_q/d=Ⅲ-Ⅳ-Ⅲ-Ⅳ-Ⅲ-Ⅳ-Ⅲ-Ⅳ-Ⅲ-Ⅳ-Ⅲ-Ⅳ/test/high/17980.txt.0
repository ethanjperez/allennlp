  "article": "The business thrived until the great depression hit the entire country . A deep depressing set in . He still had no customers to speak of , but from what he had left in the stor , he would sack a few cans to take to Julie ' s family . In early spring , Julie saw her father planting a garden . This gave her an idea . She suggested Bernie making a garden in the big space beside the store , which they had once thought would become a parking lot , and sell the produce really cheap in the store . They would plant half the garden space now and half in three weeks giving them fresh produce for a long time . They all came up and produced the best crop of vegetables Bernie had ever seen . They soon became well - known in the community for having the best prices and finest produce in town .",
