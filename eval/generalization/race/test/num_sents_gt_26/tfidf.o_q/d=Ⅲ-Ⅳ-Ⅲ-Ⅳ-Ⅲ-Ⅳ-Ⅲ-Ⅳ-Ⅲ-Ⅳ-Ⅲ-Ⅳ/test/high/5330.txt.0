  "article": "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they ' re always getting criticism . But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods . A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read . Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about . Lots of people pretend that they never read advertisements , but this claim may be seriously doubted . It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days . Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements . Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws while waiting for a train ? A cheerful , witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration of disasters . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers . What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community !",
