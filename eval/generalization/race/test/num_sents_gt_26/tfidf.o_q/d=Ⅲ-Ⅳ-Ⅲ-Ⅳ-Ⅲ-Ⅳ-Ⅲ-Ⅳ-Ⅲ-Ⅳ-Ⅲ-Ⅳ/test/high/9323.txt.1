  "article": "Occasionally , my father came back drunk . As a father who was supposed to love us , in fact , he lacked the understanding of what it truly meant to love a child - - or to hurt one . Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . It was the presence of my father that was most treasured .
