  "article": "Her interest in opals took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge . There were no luxuries , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money . She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends , but died too soon . In her honour , my aunt , Marisa , and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year . People who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society , from lawyers to travels . Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge . They haven ' t had much luck over the past couple of years , but their passion for opals conquers disappointment . Danny Hatcher , 38 , is a second - generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners ' Association .",
