  "article": "He ' d been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road . The truck ' s bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact , but the force of 23 tons would likely crush everyone inside the van . \" I figured instead of killing other people , I ' d just put the truck in the ditch . \" At the bottom , rocks cut a fuel tank , which caught fire . He came to life a couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire . Ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts on both of his legs . In February , the Coopers received a Hero of the Highway award from the Open Road Foundation for rescuing an injured driver . Steve insists Ronnie is the real hero : \" If he hadn ' t gone into the ditch , he would have hit that van . It was his decision to drive off the road .",
