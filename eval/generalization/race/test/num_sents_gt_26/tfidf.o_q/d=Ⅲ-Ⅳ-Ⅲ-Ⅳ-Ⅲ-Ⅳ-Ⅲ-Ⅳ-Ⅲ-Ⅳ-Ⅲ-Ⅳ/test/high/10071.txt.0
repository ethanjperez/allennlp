  "article": "One July morning he said good morning to the driver and smiled . The next day , the old man boarded with a big smile and said in a loud voice : \" A very good morning to you all ! \" Some of us looked up , amazed , and murmured \" Good Morning \" in reply . He said good morning to us every day and we gradually began to nod and talk to each other . Then , one morning , as autumn was closing in , Charlie wasn ' t waiting at his usual stop . When he wasn ' t there the next day and the day after that , we started wondering if he was sick or - - hopefully - on holiday somewhere . When we came nearer to the center for senior citizens , one of the passengers asked the driver to wait . We all held our breaths when he went to the door . How silent we were the rest of the way to work .",
