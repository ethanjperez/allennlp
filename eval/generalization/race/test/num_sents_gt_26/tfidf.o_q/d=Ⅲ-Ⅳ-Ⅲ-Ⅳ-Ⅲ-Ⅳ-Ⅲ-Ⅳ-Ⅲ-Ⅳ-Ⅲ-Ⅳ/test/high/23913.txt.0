  "article": "These habits have been referred to as magical thinking and can be found everywhere in daily life . \" I think in part it ' s because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts , and thus likely to overestimate their connection to outside events . For people who are uncertain of their own abilities or slow to take action , magical thinking can be a great help , explained Dr . Daniel Wegner , a professor psychology at Harvard . They are the \" adaptationists \" and the \" byproduct theorists \" . The adaptationists say that belief in magical powers makes people feel better , less worried about difficulties , more focused on the future , and more willing to care for themselves . But in byproduct theory , magical thinking is a product of our psychological features . Byproduct theorists claim that because of these features , we are born with a tendency to believe in our magical thinking . But we need to confine our magical thinking , warn psychologists .",
