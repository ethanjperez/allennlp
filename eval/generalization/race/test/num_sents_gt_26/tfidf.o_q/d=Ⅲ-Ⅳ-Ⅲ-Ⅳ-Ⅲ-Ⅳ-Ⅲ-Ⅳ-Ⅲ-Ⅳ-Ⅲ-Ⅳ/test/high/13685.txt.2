  "article": "Last week , I bought an alarm system for about $ 450 . Now I must explain how the alarm works : 1 . Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work . That might I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house . \" What shall we do ? About an hour later , the alarm started again . \" It ' s only me . I saw a house lizard disappear behind the curtains . \" When the lizard moved , it started the siren . I guessed that the alarm had been made in Europe , where there are no house lizards . We bought a dog this morning . It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar .",
