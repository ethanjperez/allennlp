  "article": "Opportunity knocked on my door last January when I was given a chance to work in another country . But I had to overcome the true challenge ! Luckily , I met seven new friends , six boys and one girl . One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible . He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him . Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most . I didn ' t know how to help him because I didn ' t have any money either . I tried to borrow money from other friends but I failed . Sometimes you can find it on the toughest time in your life !",
