Last week there was a meadow between us and he took his bulldozer to the river levee and now there is a creek between us . \" The carpenter said , \" I think I understand the situation . \" The older brother had to go to town , so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day . About sunset when the farmer returned , the carpenter had just finished his job . \" You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I ' ve said and done . \" The two brothers stood at each end of the bridge , and then they met in the middle , taking each other ' s hand .
