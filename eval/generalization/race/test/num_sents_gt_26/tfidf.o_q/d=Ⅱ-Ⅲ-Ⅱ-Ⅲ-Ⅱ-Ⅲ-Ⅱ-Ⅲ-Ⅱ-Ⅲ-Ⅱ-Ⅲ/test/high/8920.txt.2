  "article": "Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . More women are their family ' s main _ than ever before . Even though it ' s 2014 , there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work . We don ' t have second - class citizens in this country - - we shouldn ' t in the workplace , either . So let ' s make sure women earn equal pay for equal work , and have a fair shot at success . Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby , an ailing parent , or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship . So let ' s make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave . So let ' s start demanding Pre - K for our kids . And when most low - wage workers are women , but Congress hasn ' t passed a minimum wage increase in seven years , it ' s long past time that women deserve a raise . And more than half of those workers are women . So let ' s do this - - let ' s give America a raise . Because they ' ll build a stronger America for all of us .",
