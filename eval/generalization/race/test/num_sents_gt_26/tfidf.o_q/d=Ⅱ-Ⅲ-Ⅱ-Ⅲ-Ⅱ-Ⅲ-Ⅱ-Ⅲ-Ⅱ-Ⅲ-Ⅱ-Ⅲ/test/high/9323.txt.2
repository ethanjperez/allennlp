  "article": "As a father who was supposed to love us , in fact , he lacked the understanding of what it truly meant to love a child - - or to hurt one . I wanted to stop caring , but I couldn ' t . Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . But losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely lost to my father . It was the presence of my father that was most treasured . It wasn ' t until I was much older that I would find something that I would be able to _ as evidence of my father ' s love . Although he had never told me that he loved me , I would _ that day as the greatest evidence of that fact . He had never intended me any wrong . He just didn ' t know how to love me right . It just goes to show that no matter how friendless the father , no matter how deep the damage , no matter how shattered the bond , there is still time , still space , still a need for even the smallest bit of evidence of a father ' s love .",
