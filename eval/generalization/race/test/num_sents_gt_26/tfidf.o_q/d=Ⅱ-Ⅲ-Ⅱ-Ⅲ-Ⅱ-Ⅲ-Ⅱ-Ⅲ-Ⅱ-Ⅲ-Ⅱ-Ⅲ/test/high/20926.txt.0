  "article": "The first time little David came to our camp , he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments . Paul Newman ' s camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David ' s days with fun and laughter . That ' s the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all - camp activity . For the last couple days of the session , David was a different kid . He was a little nine - year - old boy again , trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible . Several days after the session , David came back again . He sure was having a great time at camp . Unfortunately , the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good - bye to camp .",
