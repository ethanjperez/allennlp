  "article": "One of the passengers was a small gray - haired man who took the bus to the center for senior citizens every morning . The next day , the old man boarded with a big smile and said in a loud voice : \" A very good morning to you all ! The driver turned around smiling and asked : \" Have you got yourself a girlfriend , Charlie ? \" We never got to know if his name really was \" Charlie \" , but he nodded shyly and said yes . When he wasn ' t there the next day and the day after that , we started wondering if he was sick or - - hopefully - on holiday somewhere . When we came nearer to the center for senior citizens , one of the passengers asked the driver to wait . We all held our breaths when he went to the door . The old gentle man was fine , but one of his close friends had died over the weekend .",
