  ],
  "article": "This technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them . So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present ; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night . Imagine that normal limitations don ' t exist . Think about your goal and the new possibilities . If , for example , your goal is to learn to ski , you can now practice skiing every day of your life ( because you have the time and the money ) .
