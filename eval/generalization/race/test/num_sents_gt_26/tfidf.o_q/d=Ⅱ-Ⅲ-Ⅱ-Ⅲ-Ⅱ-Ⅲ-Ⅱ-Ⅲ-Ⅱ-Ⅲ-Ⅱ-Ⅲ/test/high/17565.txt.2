  "article": "When , after a year of being alone on his island , Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand , the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles . Is the footprint the sign of an enemy ? Since 1719 , when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe , thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story . Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel . Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \" failure \" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler . Near the end of the Seventeenth Century , the hot - tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church . Rather than face this charge , he ran away to sea . Several years later , Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer . So , when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas , Selkirk asked to be put ashore . He was almost sixty when , in the midst of his work in politics , he wrote Robinson Crusoe . Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe ' s time .",
