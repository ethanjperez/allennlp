  "article": "Last week , I bought an alarm system for about $ 450 . I put the control unit in the sitting room and fastened the other units by the front door , back door and living - room windows . The instructions told us to choose three numbers , so we chose 491 , the last three numbers of our telephone number . Now I must explain how the alarm works : 1 . There is a power siren in the control unit . Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work . I locked it , re - set the alarm and went back to bed . About an hour later , the alarm started again . As I did so , I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows . Well , I won ' t finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge , let me know .",
