  "article": "For years we made the long drive from our home in Seattle to my parents ' home in Boise in nine hours . That is how I found myself on the road with four kids , a baby lamb and nothing but my everlasting optimism to see me through . The kids chased him and one another . They ' d get back in the car breathless and energized , smelling fresh from the cold air . Even if we simply looked out of the car windows at baby pigs following their mother , or fish leaping out of the water , it was better than the best ride down the freeway . I grew brave with the trip back home and creative with my disciplining technique . I stopped the car , ordered all kids out and told them to meet me up ahead .",
