  "article": "Poet William Stafford once said that we are defined more by the detours in life than by the narrow road toward goals . Road trips felt risky , so I would drive fast , stopping only when I had to . My husband made the decision for me . That is how I found myself on the road with four kids , a baby lamb and nothing but my everlasting optimism to see me through . We took the country roads out of necessity . Even if we simply looked out of the car windows at baby pigs following their mother , or fish leaping out of the water , it was better than the best ride down the freeway . On an empty section of road , everyone started quarreling . I stopped the car , ordered all kids out and told them to meet me up ahead . Some road trips are by necessity fast and straight . But that trip with Banner opened our eyes to a world available to anyone adventurous enough to wander around and made me realize that a detour may uncover the best part of a journey - and the best part of yourself .",
