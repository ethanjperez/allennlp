    "From the passage, the father was  _   in the writer's memory."
  ],
  "article": "In fact , it was a cruel , corrosive lie . Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . It was the presence of my father that was most treasured . It wasn ' t until I was much older that I would find something that I would be able to _ as evidence of my father ' s love . So I took these random episodes and _ them like a thing most precious , storing them in my mind for the long stretches of coldness when a warm memory would prove most useful . It just goes to show that no matter how friendless the father , no matter how deep the damage , no matter how shattered the bond , there is still time , still space , still a need for even the smallest bit of evidence of a father ' s love .",
