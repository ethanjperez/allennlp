  "article": "So we ' ve got to harness this momentum , and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead . Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . More women are their family ' s main _ than ever before . Even though it ' s 2014 , there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work . Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby , an ailing parent , or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship . Pregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly . Even today , women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks , or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant .

So let ' s do this - - let ' s give America a raise .",
