  "article": "Since 1719 , when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe , thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story . Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel . Near the end of the Seventeenth Century , the hot - tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church . Rather than face this charge , he ran away to sea . Several years later , Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer . But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain . But the Captain refused - - Selkirk had gone too far . Over four years later , Selkirk was rescued by another ship . When Selkirk got back to England , the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe . Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe ' s time .",
