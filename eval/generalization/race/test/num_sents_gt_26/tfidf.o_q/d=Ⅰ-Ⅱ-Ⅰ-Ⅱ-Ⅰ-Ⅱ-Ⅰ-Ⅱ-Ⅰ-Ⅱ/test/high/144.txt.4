  "article": "One warm September night , Mira had come down to the beach to enjoy the night air . All of a sudden she could see a tiny head coming out . Then a turtle appeared ! Sometimes they die going across the dunes , trying to find those bright lights on the houses . That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch . \" With these words , Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights . In a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her . They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves . Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water .",
