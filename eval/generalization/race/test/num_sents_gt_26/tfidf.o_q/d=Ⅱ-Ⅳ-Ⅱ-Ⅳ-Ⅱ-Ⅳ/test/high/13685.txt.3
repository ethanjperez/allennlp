  "article": "Last week , I bought an alarm system for about $ 450 . The instructions told us to choose three numbers , so we chose 491 , the last three numbers of our telephone number . Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work . I locked it , re - set the alarm and went back to bed . About an hour later , the alarm started again .",
