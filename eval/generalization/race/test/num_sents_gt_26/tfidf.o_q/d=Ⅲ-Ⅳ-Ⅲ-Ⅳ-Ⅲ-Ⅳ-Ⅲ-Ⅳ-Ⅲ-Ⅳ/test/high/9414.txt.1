  "article": "' Well , ' began Enfield , ' I was coming home about three o ' clock on a black winter morning , when suddenly I saw two people . The first was a short man who was walking along the street , and the second was a little girl who was running as fast as she could . ' \" The child is more frightened than hurt , \" said the doctor - - and that , you would think , was the end of the story . But , you see , I had taken a violent dislike to the short man . The name on the cheque was a well - known one . ' \" See here , \" said the doctor doubtfully , \" it isn ' t usual for a man to walk into an empty house at four in the morning and come out with another man ' s cheque for nearly a hundred pounds . \" ' \" Don ' t worry , \" said the man with an ugly look , \" I ' ll stay with you until the banks open , and change the cheque myself . Sure enough , the cheque was good , and the money was passed to the child ' s family .",
