  "article": "I took the bus to work for many years . One of the passengers was a small gray - haired man who took the bus to the center for senior citizens every morning . The driver turned around smiling and asked : \" Have you got yourself a girlfriend , Charlie ? Charlie waved the flowers before he sat down on his seat . Every morning after that Charlie always brought flowers . Then , one morning , as autumn was closing in , Charlie wasn ' t waiting at his usual stop . When he wasn ' t there the next day and the day after that , we started wondering if he was sick or - - hopefully - on holiday somewhere . When we came nearer to the center for senior citizens , one of the passengers asked the driver to wait . The old gentle man was fine , but one of his close friends had died over the weekend . How silent we were the rest of the way to work .",
