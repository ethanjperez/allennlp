  "article": "We don ' t expect you to take up jogging , backpacking , or hang gliding . Make the morning your activity time . Get into the water as much as you can . Don ' t allow yourself to spend your entire time sitting in front of the water . Whether it is the ocean , a swimming pool , or a tree - lined lake , make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking . And you ' ll feel so much more alive ! It ' s amazing how active you can be being stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic . Get out of the car every two hours . Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road , either getting to and from our destinations , or using the car for sightseeing . But no matter how beautiful the scenery is , great and memorable vacations don ' t happen in a car seat .",
