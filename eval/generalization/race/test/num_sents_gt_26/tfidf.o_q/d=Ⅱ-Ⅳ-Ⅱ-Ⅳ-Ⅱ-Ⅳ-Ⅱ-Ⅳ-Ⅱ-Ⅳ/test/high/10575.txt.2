  "article": "Immigration is the act of coming to a foreign country to live . Immigrants who flee their country because of persecution , war , or such disasters as famines or epidemics are known as refugees or displaced persons . The heaviest immigration worldwide took place from the early 1800 ' s to the Great Depression , the economic hard times of the 1930 ' s . The main reason for immigration has long been economic opportunity - - - - the desire for better land or a better job .
