  "article": "We found out that Jenny was suffering hearing loss when she was four and a half years old . But , as soon as she could stand the pain , Jenny , immediately , carried on , as though she were pain - free . She won a place in the Govemor ' s School for the Arts ; yet , no one in the Charleston , South Carolina School System knew what to do with Jenny . So she began to bombard the school football coach . Finally the coach gave in , with the warning , \" If you miss ONE game , you ' re out ! \" So , Jenny became Manager of Garrett High School Football Team . When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games , one team member Jack explained , \" Well , when you ' ve been knocked down , and you can ' t seem to move , you look up and see Jenny Lewis , walking across the field , dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow . \" At the Senior Awards ceremony , Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston . Her favorite scholarship , however , was a small one from the Charleston Women ' s Club .",
