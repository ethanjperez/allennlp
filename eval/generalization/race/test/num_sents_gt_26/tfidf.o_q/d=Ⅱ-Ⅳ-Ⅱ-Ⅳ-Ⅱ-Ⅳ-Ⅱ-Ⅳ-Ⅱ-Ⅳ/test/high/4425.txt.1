  "article": "The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time , but it makes a good story now . Eventually , I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates ' Court the following Monday . I wanted to conduct my own defense in court , but as soon as my father found out what had happened , he hired a very good solicitor . We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses , including my English teacher from school as a character witness . But he was never called on to give evidence . I had the ' right ' accent , respectable middle - class parents in court , reliable witnesses , and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor .",
