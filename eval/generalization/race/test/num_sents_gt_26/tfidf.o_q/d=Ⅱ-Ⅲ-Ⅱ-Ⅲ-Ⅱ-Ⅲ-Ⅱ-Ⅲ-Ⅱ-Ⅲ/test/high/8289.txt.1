  "article": "Active vacations are often the most relaxing of all . It ' s all in defining what an active vacation is . And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile . Make the morning your activity time . Get into the water as much as you can . Whether it is the ocean , a swimming pool , or a tree - lined lake , make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking . And you ' ll feel so much more alive ! It ' s amazing how active you can be being stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic . Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road , either getting to and from our destinations , or using the car for sightseeing . But no matter how beautiful the scenery is , great and memorable vacations don ' t happen in a car seat .",
