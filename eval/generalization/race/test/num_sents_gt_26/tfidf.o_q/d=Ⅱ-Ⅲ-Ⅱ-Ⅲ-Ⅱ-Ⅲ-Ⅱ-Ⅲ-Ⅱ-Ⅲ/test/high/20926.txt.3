  "article": "Paul Newman ' s camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David ' s days with fun and laughter . But David stayed inside himself , wanting to be alone , or in a corner of the cabin . That ' s the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all - camp activity . David slowly walked over to the table , leaving his comer to join the rest of us . He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists , as all the other campers looked on in disbelief , I wondered what the cabin counselor would do . For the last couple days of the session , David was a different kid . Several days after the session , David came back again . Unfortunately , the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good - bye to camp . He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis . A whole row of counselors was in tears .",
