  "article": "Mira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away , so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . \" Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September . Sometimes they die going across the dunes , trying to find those bright lights on the houses . Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes . \" Mira looked out across the dunes at her house . Mira saw her mother and father , sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch . \" With these words , Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights . In a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her .",
