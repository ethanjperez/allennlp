  "article": "So , you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief at a Chinese funeral . The next day was the funeral . At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion . In the UK , families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral . This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens . But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief - stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank , in Afghanistan , Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world . Chinese grief is no different . I realized that it ' s the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world . There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague .",
