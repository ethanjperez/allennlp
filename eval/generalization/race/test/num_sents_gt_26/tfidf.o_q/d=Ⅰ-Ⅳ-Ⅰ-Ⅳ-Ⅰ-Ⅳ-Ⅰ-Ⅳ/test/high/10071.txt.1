  "article": "The next day , the old man boarded with a big smile and said in a loud voice : \" A very good morning to you all ! \" We never got to know if his name really was \" Charlie \" , but he nodded shyly and said yes . Charlie waved the flowers before he sat down on his seat . Every morning after that Charlie always brought flowers . Then , one morning , as autumn was closing in , Charlie wasn ' t waiting at his usual stop . When he wasn ' t there the next day and the day after that , we started wondering if he was sick or - - hopefully - on holiday somewhere . We all held our breaths when he went to the door . The next Monday Charlie was waiting at the stop , stooping a bit more , a little bit more gray , and without a tie .",
