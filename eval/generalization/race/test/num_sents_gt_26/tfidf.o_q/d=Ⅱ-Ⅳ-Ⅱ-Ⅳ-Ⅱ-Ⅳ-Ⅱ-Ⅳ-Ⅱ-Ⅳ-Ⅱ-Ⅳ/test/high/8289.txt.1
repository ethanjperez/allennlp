  "article": "Active vacations are often the most relaxing of all . It ' s all in defining what an active vacation is . We don ' t expect you to take up jogging , backpacking , or hang gliding . And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile . Don ' t allow yourself to spend your entire time sitting in front of the water . Get out of the car every two hours . Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road , either getting to and from our destinations , or using the car for sightseeing . But no matter how beautiful the scenery is , great and memorable vacations don ' t happen in a car seat . Don ' t wait for tiredness or nature ' s call to get you to pull over .",
