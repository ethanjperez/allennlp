  "article": "No one is sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids near Cairo . People have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks . The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away . The most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths . Then they would have dragged them along paths . Evidence from the sand supports this idea . Researchers found small amounts of fat , as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths . West hasn ' t tested his idea on larger blocks , but he thinks rolling has clear advantages over sliding . At least , workers wouldn ' t have needed to carry cattle fat or water to smooth the paths .",
