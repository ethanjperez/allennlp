  "article": "Immigration is the act of coming to a foreign country to live . The heaviest immigration worldwide took place from the early 1800 ' s to the Great Depression , the economic hard times of the 1930 ' s . People abandon their homeland and move to another country for various reasons . The main reason for immigration has long been economic opportunity - - - - the desire for better land or a better job . At times , the United States , like many receiving countries , has restricted immigration to maintain a more homogeneous society in which all the people share the same ethnic , geographic , and cultural background . Although some immigration laws have been relaxed , many new comers of different backgrounds still face challenges in gaining acceptance .",
