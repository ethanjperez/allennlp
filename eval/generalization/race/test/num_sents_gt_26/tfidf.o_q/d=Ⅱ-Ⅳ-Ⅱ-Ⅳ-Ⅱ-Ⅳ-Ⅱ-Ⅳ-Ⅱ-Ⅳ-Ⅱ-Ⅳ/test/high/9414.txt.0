  "article": "The first was a short man who was walking along the street , and the second was a little girl who was running as fast as she could . I ran after the man , caught him and fetched him back . The child ' s family then arrived , and also a doctor . The child had been sent to fetch the doctor for a sick neighbor , and was on her way home again . ' \" The child is more frightened than hurt , \" said the doctor - - and that , you would think , was the end of the story . But , you see , I had taken a violent dislike to the short man . But the doctor , who seemed a quiet , kind man , was also looking at our prisoner with murder in his eyes . ' The doctor and I understood each other perfectly . \" ' So we all went off , the doctor and the prisoner and myself , and spent the rest of the night at my house . Sure enough , the cheque was good , and the money was passed to the child ' s family .",
