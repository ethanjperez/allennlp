  "article": "But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods . A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read . Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about . Lots of people pretend that they never read advertisements , but this claim may be seriously doubted . It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days . And what fun they often are , too ! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements .",
