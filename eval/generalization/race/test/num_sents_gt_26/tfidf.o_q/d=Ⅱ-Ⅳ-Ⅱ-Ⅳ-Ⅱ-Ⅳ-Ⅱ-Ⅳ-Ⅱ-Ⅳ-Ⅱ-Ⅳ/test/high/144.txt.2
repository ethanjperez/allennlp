  "article": "Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles . Mira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away , so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . Suddenly , she remembered something her grandmother had told her . Those baby turtles hatch and head back down to the sea . That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles . \" Mira looked out across the dunes at her house . Mira saw her mother and father , sitting on the porch . Mira began to run to her house and shouted , \" The turtles are hatching ! We have to help the turtles ! \" With these words , Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights .",
