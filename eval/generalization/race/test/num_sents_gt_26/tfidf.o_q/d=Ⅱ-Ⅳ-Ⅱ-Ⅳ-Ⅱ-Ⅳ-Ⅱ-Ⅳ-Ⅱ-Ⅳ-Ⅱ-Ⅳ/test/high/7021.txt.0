  "article": "Scholarship Application Tips in 2014 for college students * Before you apply 1 . Sports , clubs , drama , bands and orchestras - these often count toward a student ' s overall scholarship application evaluation . Begin your scholarship research early - by your sophomore or junior year of high school , if possible . Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for - several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money . Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program ' s focus ( community service , subject interest ) . Write down everything you can think of for each question , then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off . If a third party has to complete part of your application , such as providing a letter of recommendation , make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials . Good luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs !",
