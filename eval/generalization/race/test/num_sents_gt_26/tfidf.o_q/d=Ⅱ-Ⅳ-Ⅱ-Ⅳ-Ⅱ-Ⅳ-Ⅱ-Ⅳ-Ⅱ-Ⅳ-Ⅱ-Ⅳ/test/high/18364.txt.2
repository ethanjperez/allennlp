  "article": "Opportunity knocked on my door last January when I was given a chance to work in another country . One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible . He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him . Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most . I didn ' t know how to help him because I didn ' t have any money either . So I went to the hospital with him . I talked to the surgeon , asking him to do the surgery for him and promising to pay the expenses the next day ( As if I had that money ) . I tried to borrow money from other friends but I failed . I tried selling my things but no one wanted them . Then I had to talk to my boss . As soon as I had the money I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills . Sometimes you can find it on the toughest time in your life !",
