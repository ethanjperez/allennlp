  "article": "At this camp for children with life - threatening illnesses , we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness . But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him . He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists , as all the other campers looked on in disbelief , I wondered what the cabin counselor would do . He was a little nine - year - old boy again , trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible . I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death . You walk through the door and there ' s the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you .",
