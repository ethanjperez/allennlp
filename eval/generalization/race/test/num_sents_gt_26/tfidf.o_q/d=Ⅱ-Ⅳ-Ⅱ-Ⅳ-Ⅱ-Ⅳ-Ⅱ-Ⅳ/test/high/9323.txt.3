  "article": "Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . He sat up front in the dining area , drinking coffee and being particular about the restaurant ' s measly offerings . I loved these days . It was the presence of my father that was most treasured . It was one of the best days of my life .
