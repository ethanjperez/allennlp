  "article": "Thanks to the work we ' ve all put in , our economy has come a long way these past six years . Over the past 55 months , our businesses have added 10 . And on Thursday , we learned that over the past six months , our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003 . But the gains of a growing economy aren ' t yet felt by everyone . In recent weeks , I ' ve talked about these choices , from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing . Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . Right now , women make up almost half of our workers . And we should be choosing policies that benefit women - - because that benefits all of us . And when most low - wage workers are women , but Congress hasn ' t passed a minimum wage increase in seven years , it ' s long past time that women deserve a raise . About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour . And more than half of those workers are women . The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit , too .",
