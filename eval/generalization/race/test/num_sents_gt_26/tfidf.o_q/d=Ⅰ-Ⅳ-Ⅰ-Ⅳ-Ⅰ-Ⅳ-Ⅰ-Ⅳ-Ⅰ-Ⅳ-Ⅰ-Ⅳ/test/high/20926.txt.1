  "article": "He was also very angry . Paul Newman ' s camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David ' s days with fun and laughter . On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips . He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing it with his little fists , as all the other campers looked on in disbelief , I wondered what the cabin counselor would do . The college - age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself , and he , too , started smashing it with his fist . The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists . Unfortunately , the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good - bye to camp .",
