  "article": "But one day in a train something did happen . It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning , and it is never late . In a short time the corridor was full too , and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train . In order to get out of the train , I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end . But then , very slowly , the train began to move . The train moved a little faster . Then the train stopped . No one likes to stop a train if there is no need .",
