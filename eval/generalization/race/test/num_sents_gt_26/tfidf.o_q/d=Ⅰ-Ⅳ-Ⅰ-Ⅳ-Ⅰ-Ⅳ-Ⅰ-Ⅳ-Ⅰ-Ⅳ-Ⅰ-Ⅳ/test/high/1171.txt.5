  "article": "He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence . They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday . Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him . Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist . \" Tom looked at the boy a bit , and said \" What do you call work ? \" Tom went back to his whitewashing , and answered carelessly . Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day ? \" Tom thought for a moment , was about to agree ; but he changed his mind . \" Tom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face , but joy in his heart . And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun , Tom sat under a tree , eating the apple , and planning how to get more help . And when the middle of the afternoon came , Tom had won many treasures . He had discovered a great law of human action , namely , that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing , it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get .",
