Mira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away , so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . Suddenly , she remembered something her grandmother had told her . \" Mira looked out across the dunes at her house . Mira saw her mother and father , sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch . In a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her . They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves . Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water .",
