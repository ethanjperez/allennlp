  "article": "When , after a year of being alone on his island , Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand , the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles . Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness ? Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel . Near the end of the Seventeenth Century , the hot - tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church . Several years later , Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer . But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain . But the Captain refused - - Selkirk had gone too far . Over four years later , Selkirk was rescued by another ship . When Selkirk got back to England , the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe . He was almost sixty when , in the midst of his work in politics , he wrote Robinson Crusoe . \" The detail of Crusoe ' s battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author ' s imagination for reality . Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe ' s time .",
