  "article": "It means that as a human being you take responsibility for your own life . Their behavior is a product of their own decisions , based on values , rather than being a product of their own conditions , based on feelings . They realize what their purpose really was , and they creatively have a picnic elsewhere even if it ' s in their own basement with some special games , and make the best of that situation . \" \" We can ' t do anything . Your basic nature is to act , and not to be acted upon . That ' s true , despite widely accepted theories of determinism used to explain human nature . Determinism says that you don ' t really choose anything and that what you call choices are nothing more than automatic responses to outside conditions . They think things are determined by their environment , or by their conditions , or by their conditioning or their genetic makeup . Psychologically , people who believe they are determined will produce the evidence to support the belief , and they increasingly feel victimized and out of control .",
