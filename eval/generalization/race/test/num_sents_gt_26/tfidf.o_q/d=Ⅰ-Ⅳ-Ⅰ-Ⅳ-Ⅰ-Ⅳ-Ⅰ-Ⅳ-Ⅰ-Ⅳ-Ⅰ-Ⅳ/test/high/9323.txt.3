  "article": "Maybe it was his own complicated relationship to his father and his father ' s family that caused him cold . My favorite books were a set of encyclopedias given by my uncle . But losing myself in my own mind also meant that I was completely lost to my father . My best memories of him were from his episodic attempts at engagement with us . He sat up front in the dining area , drinking coffee and being particular about the restaurant ' s measly offerings . I loved these days . It was the presence of my father that was most treasured . It wasn ' t until I was much older that I would find something that I would be able to _ as evidence of my father ' s love . It was one of the best days of my life . It just goes to show that no matter how friendless the father , no matter how deep the damage , no matter how shattered the bond , there is still time , still space , still a need for even the smallest bit of evidence of a father ' s love .",
