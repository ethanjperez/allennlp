  "article": "Life is too short to waste a moment , so while you still have time , let your hair down , remove that \" boring \" tag in your so - called life and start making it worthwhile . Enjoy what you have and work on getting the things you desire . Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder , so be happy . Life is all about taking risks , and that ' s the exciting part of it . Once you learn how to take risks , you ' ll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by . Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present . Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline , not to stress you out , but to remind you of your goals . So don ' t put limits to yourself because you ' ll never know what may happen . You might enjoy it ! Go to a foreign place where you know no one .",
