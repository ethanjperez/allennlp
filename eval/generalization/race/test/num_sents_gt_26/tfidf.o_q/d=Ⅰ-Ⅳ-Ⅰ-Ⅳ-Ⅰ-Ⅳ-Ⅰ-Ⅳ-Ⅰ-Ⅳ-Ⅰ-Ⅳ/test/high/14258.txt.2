If we care for a person , if we are always ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person , they are our good friends . The friendship is so deep and the relationship is so close , that most of the things are automatically understood by our friends . During love , we are attached with a particular person , while in friendship , one may have many friends . Your heart beats will never increase in expectation of meeting your friend . You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend . You will not feel totally lost , if you don ' t meet your friend for a few days . You will not have dreams in your eyes thinking about your friend . But in love , you will do all these and much more .",
