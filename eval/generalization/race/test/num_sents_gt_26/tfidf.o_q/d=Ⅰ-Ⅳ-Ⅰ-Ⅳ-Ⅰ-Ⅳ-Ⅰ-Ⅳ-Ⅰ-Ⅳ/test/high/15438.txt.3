  "article": "\" What is the most important thing you ' ve done in your life ? It ' s not the one I gave , because the situation was not right . It was my friend ' s father , who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital . In a flash my friend was in the car and gone , disappearing in a cloud of dust . Follow my friend to the hospital ? But my friend and his wife both had large families , and I knew they ' d be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support , whatever happened . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn ' t the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",
