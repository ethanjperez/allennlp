  "article": "Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . More women are their family ' s main _ than ever before . Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby , an ailing parent , or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship . Pregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly .
