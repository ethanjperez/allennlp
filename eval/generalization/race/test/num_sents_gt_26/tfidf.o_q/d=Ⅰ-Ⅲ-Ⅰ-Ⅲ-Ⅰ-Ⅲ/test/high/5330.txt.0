  "article": "Advertisers tend to think big and perhaps this is why they ' re always getting criticism . Lots of people pretend that they never read advertisements , but this claim may be seriously doubted . It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days . Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers . What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community !",
