  "article": "\" When I was teaching at Columbia , I wanted to write , but class periods , theme - reading , and committee meetings filled my days and evenings . To my astonishment , at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision , later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method . Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever , in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use .
