  "article": "My marks in school were miserable and , the thing was , I didn ' t know enough to really care . We watched TV every night . After supper , we ' d lie on Mom ' s bed and stare for hours at the TV screen . She turned off the TV . But , she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time . She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books . But she explained that we would go where the books were : \" I ' ll drive you to the library . It didn ' t dawn on me at the time , but the experience was quite different from watching TV . Now my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children ' s Center in Baltimore . Sometimes I still can ' t believe my life ' s journey , from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position , which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery . But I know when the journey began the day Mom switched off the TV set and put us in her Oldsmobile for that drive to the library .",
