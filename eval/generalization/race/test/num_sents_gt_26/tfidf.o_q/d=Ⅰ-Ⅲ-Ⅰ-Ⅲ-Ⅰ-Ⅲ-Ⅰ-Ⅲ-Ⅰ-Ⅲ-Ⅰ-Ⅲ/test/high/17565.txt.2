  "article": "When , after a year of being alone on his island , Robinson Crusoe sees a footprint in the sand , the reader of Robinson Crusoe trembles . Is the footprint the sign of an enemy ? Near the end of the Seventeenth Century , the hot - tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church . Rather than face this charge , he ran away to sea . Several years later , Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer . But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain . So , when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas , Selkirk asked to be put ashore . But the Captain refused - - Selkirk had gone too far . Over four years later , Selkirk was rescued by another ship . When Selkirk got back to England , the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe . He was almost sixty when , in the midst of his work in politics , he wrote Robinson Crusoe .",
