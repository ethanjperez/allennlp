  "article": "In recent weeks , I ' ve talked about these choices , from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing . Today , I want to focus on what I discussed with those women - - the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today ' s economy . And we should be choosing policies that benefit women - - because that benefits all of us . Women deserve fair pay . So let ' s make sure women earn equal pay for equal work , and have a fair shot at success . That ' s wrong - - and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect . And when most low - wage workers are women , but Congress hasn ' t passed a minimum wage increase in seven years , it ' s long past time that women deserve a raise . About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour . All of these policies are common sense .",
