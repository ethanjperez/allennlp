  "article": "Scholarship Application Tips in 2014 for college students * Before you apply 1 . Work hard to get good grades . Get involved , and stay involved , in extracurricular activities . Sports , clubs , drama , bands and orchestras - these often count toward a student ' s overall scholarship application evaluation . The same goes for paid ( or unpaid ) work experience . Begin your scholarship research early - by your sophomore or junior year of high school , if possible . Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for - several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money . Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program ' s focus ( community service , subject interest ) . Good luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs !",
