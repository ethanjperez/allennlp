  "article": "And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him , I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas . If you aren ' t sure why this is important , think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs ' reverence ( respect ) for ideas : And just as Steve loved ideas , and loved making stuff , he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence .
