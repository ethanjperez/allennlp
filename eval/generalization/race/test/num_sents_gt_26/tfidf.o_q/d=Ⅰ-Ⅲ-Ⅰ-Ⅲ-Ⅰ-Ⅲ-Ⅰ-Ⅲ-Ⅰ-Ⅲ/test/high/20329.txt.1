Last week there was a meadow between us and he took his bulldozer to the river levee and now there is a creek between us . I want you to build me a fence - - an 8 - foot fence - - so I won ' t need to see his place or his face any more . \" The carpenter said , \" I think I understand the situation . \" The older brother had to go to town , so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day . There was no fence there at all . It was a bridge - - a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other ! A fine piece of work - - and his younger brother , was coming across , his hand spread out . \" I ' d love to stay on , \" the carpenter said , \" but , I have many more bridges to build .",
