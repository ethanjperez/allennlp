  "article": "One warm September night , Mira had come down to the beach to enjoy the night air . Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles . \" Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September . Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes . \" Mira looked out across the dunes at her house . Mira saw her mother and father , sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch . \" With these words , Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights . They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves .",
