  "article": "Make the morning your activity time . At that time it is most likely that the weather will be friendlier , your energy level higher , and your schedule emptier than later in the day . Get into the water as much as you can . Don ' t allow yourself to spend your entire time sitting in front of the water . Whether it is the ocean , a swimming pool , or a tree - lined lake , make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking . Merely standing in waist - high water is a good workout , thanks to the action of the water . And you ' ll feel so much more alive ! It ' s amazing how active you can be being stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic .",
