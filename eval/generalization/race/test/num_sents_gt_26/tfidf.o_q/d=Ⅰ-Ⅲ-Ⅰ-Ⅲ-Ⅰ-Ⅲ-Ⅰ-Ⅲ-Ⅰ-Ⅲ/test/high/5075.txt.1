  "article": "The dirt road made our car jump as we traveled to the Millennium Village in Sauri , Kenya . When we reached the village , we walked to the Bar Sauri Primary School to meet the people . The Millennium Village project was created to help reach the Millennium Development Goals , which were set by the United Nations in 2000 . The plan is to get people out of poverty , assure them of access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities . On that day in 2004 , we followed the village leaders into Yala Sub - District Hospital . When my kids are my age , I want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history . It will not be an easy task . But Sauri ' s progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime .",
