  "article": "\" What is the most important thing you ' ve done in your life ? It ' s not the one I gave , because the situation was not right . But my friend and his wife both had large families , and I knew they ' d be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support , whatever happened . My friend ' s wife hugged me , too , and said , \" Thanks for being here . \" For the rest of that morning , I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son , and say goodbye . None of the things I had learned in university , in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation . And yet it was critical that I do just that - - - just be there when someone needed me . Law school taught me how to take a set of facts , break them down and organized them . From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn ' t the money you make , the status you attain or the honors you achieve .",
