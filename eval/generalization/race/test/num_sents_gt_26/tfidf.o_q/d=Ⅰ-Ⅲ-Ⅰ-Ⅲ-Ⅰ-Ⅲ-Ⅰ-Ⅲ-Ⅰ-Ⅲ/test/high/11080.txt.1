    "Why is rolling better than sliding according to West ?"
  ],
  "article": "The most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths . However , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . I thought , \" Why don ' t they just try rolling the things ? They calculated that rolling the block required about as much force as moving it along a slippery path . West hasn ' t tested his idea on larger blocks , but he thinks rolling has clear advantages over sliding . At least , workers wouldn ' t have needed to carry cattle fat or water to smooth the paths .",
