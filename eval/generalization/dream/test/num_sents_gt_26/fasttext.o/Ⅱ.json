Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables .

[ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ?

In today ' s show , our young , but experienced , guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons . Welcome , Joshua . [ Thank you very much . ] Now , Joshua , I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book . What exactly is a bearded dragon ? Guest : Well , here . Why don ' t you hold on to Bert , [ Oh . . . Wow ! ] while I talk about him . [ Okay ] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia , and this is one of several species that survived in that climate . Today , beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US . dragonProgram Host : Okay . And , so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon ? I mean , can you raise one as a family pet ? Guest : Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures . Program Host : Yeah , this one seems quite friendly . Guest : You just need to know how to care for them . Program Host : Well , what are some of the things you should keep in mind ? Guest : First , you need to have the right supplies : some kind of enclosure . . . Program Host : Like , like a cage or something like that . Guest : Yeah . [ Okay ] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [ Okay ] , branches and rocks to climb on and bask on , a food or water dish , and something to line bottom of the cage . Program Host : Okay , well , let ' s get down to some the basics . What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon ? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast . Perhaps , uh , they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that . greensGuest : No , bearded dragons are omnivores . . . Program Host : Now , Omnivores ? What exactly is that ? Guest : Uh , creatures that eat insects , vegetable , and greens , the leafy parts of plants and their stems . Program Host : Okay . You mean like , for example , carrots or something like that for example . [ Yeah ] Okay . Guest : Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day , along with some greens and shredded vegetables . [ Okay . ] And then as your dragon grows , you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables . [ Alright . ] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth . Program Host : Okay , and what about water ? Uh , what kind of needs do they have for that ? Guest : Well , since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions , they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat , so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water . [ Okay . ] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish . Whatever you do , but sure to keep the cage dry , [ Okay . ] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick . Guest : [ Okay . ] , and finally , you mentioned about lighting earlier . What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy ? baskGuest : Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies . First , they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet ( UV ) bulb . . . Program Host : Now , is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned ? Okay . Guest : . . . to absorb rays [ Okay . ] , vital to the production of certain vitamins , [ Okay . ] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process . Program Host : Now , what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area ? Guest : Like ninety to a hundred degrees .

Program Host : Okay , uh , so , perhaps then , I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight ? Would that work ?

M : Hello , Mary . How nice to see you again . How ' s everything going ? W : Fine . Busy these days ? M : Yeah . With lots of things to do . Would you like to join me for a drink ? W : Ok , thanks . M : Any news recently ? W : Oh , well , I read in the local paper the other day that the government is planning to build an airport here , you know that ? M : I ' m afraid not . W : Well , my real objection to this idea of a new airport is , is the whole thing is so wasteful , I mean , we know we are currently in fuel crises , we know that we ' ve got to conserve oil and fuel and all the rest of it , and get here the government seems quite deliberately to be encouraging people to , . . . to travel , to use and these jets use a hack of a lot of oil , I mean it takes a ton of oil , a ton of petrol before one of these big jets even takes off . M : Mm . . . W : It seems so completely short - sighted to me . Quite apart from all the ways to the land and so on , I can ' t see , I can ' t see the rationale behind really wanting an , an airport at all . M : Well , surely you must have to admit that the existing airport nearby are becoming swarmed . I mean , why should people , uhh . . . W : Well , they aren ' t being swarmed . M : Be treated like cattle when there is a chance of . . . a new airport here . W : But , but really people shouldn ' t be traveling that much , that ' s , that ' s why most of the journeys , I mean , they swamped because there is far too much unnecessary tourism and so on . It isn ' t necessary for people to travel so far or even so often . M : Well , you take the climate here in this country . Now just before Christmas , there was this dreadful cold spell , there was a tremendous increase in number of people who wanted to leave and spent Christmas and the New Year in a reasonable climate of sun and , and a certain mild climate . And , and in summer , the same situation occurs . It is unbearably hot here and people want to go somewhere cool . W : Well , yes , I can sympathize with that . But it is still not really necessary to do , well , as it isn ' t necessary to , to conserve fuel and it is necessary to , well , not to waste land . I mean land for a new airport could be used for far more important things which would benefit the people here far more . I mean it could be used for farming for instance . M : True . W : It could also be used for housing , or it could be used for parks , you know . People then could come and enjoy themselves without having to travel far . M : But , airports do bring some local advantages . They bring roads , there is obviously extra employment , for instance , new hotels , shops , restaurants will have to be built . This means more jobs for the locals and it is good for local economy . W : But you ask the people , you ask those who are now living near the airports , for instance , whether , whether they recon that airpotrs bring them advantages , although , all the airports bring in are noise and vast motorways , and the whole area is , is desolated , isn ' t it ? M : But the airport infra , . . . , infrastructure relies on housing and other facilities for the great number of people who would be employed in the airport , the pilots even , the stewardess , they have to live somewhere near the airport , right ? W : Yeah , but it ' s , it ' s just so , so damaging to the whole area . I think , airports , from my point of view , the whole concept is outdated , really . Umm , with modern technology , we can make a lot of travel unnecessary , really . For example , it won ' t be necessary for businessmen to fly out to a foreign county to talk to somebody . They can just leave it to the telephone in the office , press the button , and say to the person they want to do business with . You see , business deals can be made without having to travel back and forth , right ? M : Yes , you are right . But for a lot of people , personal contact is important .

M : It ' s an expanding market , that ' s for sure , and they seem to be getting smaller every year . F : Which countries are dominating the market ? M : At the moment it ' s Japan , principally . In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman ? F : Is that the Walkman ? M : No , the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial . F : How big is the whole thing ? M : Oh , I ' d say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms . F : Was it a success from the start ? M : Funnily enough , a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around - and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price ! F : Really ? M : But , despite this pessimistic view , sales of this model far outnumbered projections . F : Well , you never can tell ! How big was the initial production ? M : The company started with 2 , 000 units per month and increased to 5 , 000 by the end of 1982 , but they still couldn ' t keep up with the demand . F : So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher . M : It was much more radical than that ! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model . F : Oh , what ' s it like ? M : Well , it ' s 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less . . . F : Mmmm . M : and the components were designed from scratch . F : And what about production levels ? M : They quadrupled to 20 , 000 units a month just for the Japanese market ! F : Wow ! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off . M : Indeed it has . F : And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well . M : Yes . At the end of 1982 Hattori - that ' s H - A - T - T - O - R - I - - you know , the makers of Seiko watches - well , they unveiled an even smaller TV , around 3era , which is built into a wrist - watch . F : Incredible ! M : It certainly is . The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and it ' s about the size of a packet of kingsize cigarettes . F : And how does it work ? M : It has a liquid crystal display screen . The TV receiver and battery pack fit into your pocket , and they ' re connected by a cord to the watch . F : Is there a headphone ? M : Oh , yes , that ' s plugged into the receiver as well . F : Seems a bit complicated , that one , with all the wires and bits and pieces . M : Yes , it does . F : Any other Japanese models ? M : Yes , Casio - that ' s C - A - S - I - O . Their latest is a calculator - sized TV about one - third the bulk of the Watchman and with 1983 production figures of 2000 units a month . F : I see . M : And , according to a spokesman , they hope to match their calculator sales , which are about 25 million units per year . F : Very impressive . And no doubt other Japanese companies will jump on the bandwagon . M : Most likely . F : Now , could you tell us about other countries making these tiny TVs ? M : Of course . From Sinclair in England there ' s one similar in size to the Casio , and their production levels were 1 million for 1983 . F : Obviously they ' re planning on backing a winner ! M : How right you are . A representative said they expect a mass - market response , not just a novelty item . F : And just which market are the manufactures aiming at ?
