Apartment Owner : Oh , yeah . The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator , stove , and my grandmother ' s old dishwasher . Caller : Your grandmother ' s old dishwasher ? Okay . What ' s the rent ? Apartment Owner : It ' s $ 950 a month . Apartment Owner : Whoa . That is a little steep for me . Caller : But you could always split the cost with a roommate . Caller : Perhaps .

Caller : Oh , and how much is the deposit ?

Man , that was ugly . Plaster falling down from the ceiling . And I didn ' t even know there was a rat ' s nest up there , but we got that taken care of . Caller : A what ? Do I get my deposit back after I move out ? That ' s assuming that I even move in .

Caller : Okay . Oh , um . . . how close is the apartment to the university campus ? Apartment Owner : It ' s about eight blocks from campus , but you can catch a number of busses right out in front . Caller : Oh , so , then , if there ' s a busy road out front , is it noisy ? Apartment Owner : Well , there are always trade - offs : it ' s a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you , but the place is really convenient because there ' s a supermarket and shopping center right across the street . Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy , and you ' ll be fine . Caller : Okay , and one last question . Are there parking spaces for tenants ? Apartment Owner : Yeah . The apartment has two covered parking spaces , which are really convenient during certain times of the year . Caller : Uh . . . I don ' t know . Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning ? Apartment Owner : Sure , but just remember we rent the apartment on a first - come , first - serve basis , so there ' s no guarantee it ' ll still be available then . Caller : Okay . Thanks . Um . . . and where exactly is the apartment located ? Apartment Owner : It ' s one block west of the waste water treatment plant . Caller : Ah . . . . Are pets allowed ?

Beechgrove School ? This is Mr . Holloway speaking . Brad Holloway . I ' m ringing about my son Michael . He came home yesterday and said he ' d been in trouble at school with his P . E . teacher , Miss Sanderson . She said he didn ' t have the right kit for P . E . Everyone else thought it was all highly amusing , of course , and Michael was very embarrassed about it . Perhaps I could speak to the Headmistress . W : She ' s engaged at the moment , I ' m afraid . This is her secretary . M : I can hold on for a while if she ' s going to be free soon . . . W : I have a feeling she ' s going to be busy all morning , Mr . Holloway . She ' s at a Governors ' meeting . It could go on for a very long time . . . M : Oh . Well , in that case , perhaps you could help me . W : Of course . What form is Michael in ? M : He ' s a first year . He ' s in 1B . His form teacher ' s Mr . Hopkins . W : And what kit should Michael have brought with him ? M : Well that ' s the point . In the school information booklet it says black shorts and blue singlet , with black or blue plimsolls . So that ' s what we bought him . We went to the sports shop the school actually recommends . You know , Atlas Sports , West Street . W : I ' m just looking at the information booklet , Mr . Holloway . There seems to have been some mistake . M : I thought so . Maybe you could point it out to Miss Sanderson . W : What Michael came to school with was the senior girls ' basketball kit . M : What ? How on earth could that have happened ? It says quite clearly in the booklet , black shorts and blue vest . I ' ve got it in front of me . W : You ' re looking at the top of Page 11 , aren ' t you ? M : That ' s right . W : Well , unfortunately the layout of the booklet is a bit misleading . If you look at the bottom of the previous page you ' ll see it says Boys ' Kit in the left - hand column and Girls ' Kit in the right - hand one , but when you turn over the page it ' s not difficult to forget which column was which because the headings aren ' t repeated . M : So it looks as though were going to have to write another cheque . . . W : I ' m afraid so . M : Oh well . Anything for a quiet life , I suppose . Perhaps yon could ask Miss Sanderson to be patient for a week or so to give us time to buy the right kit . W : Of course . Goodbye Mr .
