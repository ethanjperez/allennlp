Coupled with this fact is the warning that soon we will no longer have workforce to fill the many jobs that require properly - educated personnel . The highest student dropout rate is not a recent development . Ten years ago , many urban schools were reporting dropout rates between 35 and 50 percent . Some administrators believe that dropout remains the single greatest problem in their schools . Consequently , much effort has been spent on identifying students with problems in order to give them more attention before they become failures . Since the dropout problem doesn ' t only start in senior high school , special programs in junior high school focus on students who show promise but have a record of truancy , that is , staying away from school without permission . Under the guidance of counselors , these students are placed in classes with teachers who have had success in working with similar young people . Ways to motivate students in high school include rewarding academic excellence by electing scholars of the month , or by giving out clothing , such as school letter jackets formally given only to athletes . No one working with these students claims to know how to keep all students in school . Counselors , teachers , and administrators are in the frontlines of what seems at times to be a losing battle .

He must see that everything is running smoothly . He will have to give advice and make decisions as problems arise , and he must know how to get his huge staff to work efficiently with their respective responsibilities .

As early as 1834 , an English lady , Mrs . Gutzlaff , wife of a missionary to China , came to Macao . Supported by the Ladies ' Association in London for the promotion of female education in India and the East , she immediately took up the work of starting a girls ' school for Chinese girls , which was soon followed by the opening of a boys ' school . Mrs . Gutzlaff ' s comprador happened to come from my village and was actually my father ' s friend and neighbor . It was through him that my parents heard about Mrs . Gutzlaff ' s school and it was doubtlessly through his influence and means that my father got me admitted into the school . It has always been a mystery to me why my parents should put me into a foreign school , instead of a traditional Confucian school , where my big brother was placed . Most certainly such a step would have been more suitable for Chinese public opinion , taste , and the wants of the country , than to allow me to attend an English school .

In 1959 there was international concern over the flooding of the Abu Simbel temples , a treasure of ancient Egyptian civilization , to build the Aswan High Dam in Egypt . Through an international campaign by UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) on the request of Egypt and Sudan , resources were found to move the temples to a new site . In 1965 , a conference at the White House in Washington DC , USA called for a \" World Heritage Trust \" and international cooperation to protect \" the world ' s superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future \" . In 1969 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) developed similar proposals for its members . Therefore , the Convention was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972 . By regarding heritage as both cultural and natural , the Convention reminds us of the ways in which people interact with nature , and of the basic need to keep the balance between the two . The Convention identifies the natural or cultural sites on the World Heritage List , and sets out their role in protecting them . Although the emphasis has been on sites and natural features of \" outstanding universal value \" , each country promises not only to _ the World Heritage sites situated in its country , but also to protect and conserve its cultural and natural heritage .

Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat , it has , at the same time , made many foods unfit to eat . Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of human illness is related to food and forty percent of cancer is related to food as well . That food is related to illness is not a new discovery . In 1945 , some researchers realized that things commonly used to keep colour in meats and other food additives caused cancer . Yet , these additives remain in our food , and it is difficult to know which things on the wrappings of foods are helpful or harmful . The additives which we eat are not all so direct . Farmers often give penicillin to their animals , and because of this , penicillin has been found in the milk of cows . Sometimes similar tings are supplied to animals not for their health , but just to make a profit . The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to get a higher price on the market .

Islanders point to the desert insects that land on beaches after a 5 , 000 - kilometer flight across the Atlantic . If they can use winds to get from one continent to another , so can clouds of dust that carry disease . Scientists think that as Africa becomes drier , dust from expanding deserts is being blown away into Caribbean islands . A study in Barbados shows that asthma has increased 17 times since Africa ' s drought began in 1973 . Other forms of life are suffering , too . Among them are the Caribbean ' s famous coral reefs ( ) , which began dying in large numbers in the 1900s . Eugene Shinn of the U . S . Geiological Sudrvey ( USGS ) in Florida went to the virgin Islands to study the reefs . The tests he and his colleagues carried out showed that the coral was dying of disease caused by Africa microbes from across the ocean . William Sprigg of the University of Arizona is studying the problem as part of a major UN project . He says that dust is causing problems in the U .

In addition to that , roads , parking lots , and yet more buildings are being constructed . The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city ' s air temperature , air quality and energy costs . On a summer day in most American cities , a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven . But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden ? Whether it holds vegetable gardens , wildflowers , or meadow grasses , a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees , which can reduce the building ' s energy costs . If used more widely , green roofs could decrease a city ' s total energy costs , reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health . But that ' s not all - - green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage systems , and actually extend the life time of the roof itself . And green roofs do something else : They beautify the city - - whether you ' re on the 3rd floor or the 30th . Now that ' s a great achievement . The environmental nonprofit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs progamme .

Klose said Volvo Cars had entered a new time of fast development , adding that its sales volume in China in 2010 . Up to the end of September , Volvo ' s global sales volume was up 12 . 5 percent year on year , compared with 52 percent year - on - year rise in China , he said . Two new Volvo sales centers opened in Beijing within merely one week in early October , about two months after east China ' s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co acquired the Swedish brand from the US auto giant Ford for $ 1 . 5 billion in early August . Klose said he was confident of seeing tremendous growth in China ' s auto market in the next five years . \" As the Chinese government has increased the tax rate for large displacement cars already , we now have a lot of cars below three liters , and I think we ' ll stick to that strategy , as you can see now the XC60 which was introduced today is just two liters , \" he said . \" As the technology advances , we ' ll probably even see 1 . 6 liter engines or 1 . 5 liter engines in the future , \" he added .
