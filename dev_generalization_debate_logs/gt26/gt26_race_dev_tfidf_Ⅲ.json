What ' s worse , he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking . He asked , \" What ' s for dinner , Mom ? \" after he had just eaten . Poor Andrew , he was only 15 ! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor . A brain scan made it clear : Andrew had a malignant brain tumor . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory . He should be operated on as soon as possible . Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor , but Andrew ' s memory was still poor . He was told he would probably never go back to school . Andrew was eager to enter a university , but it seemed that his dream wouldn ' t come true . \" Even though they told me this , I knew I wanted to go back to school , \" Andrew said . \" I wanted to get my memory back . \" Andrew began by auditing an English class at a nearby school .

He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones . How magnificent it will be ! His ordinary life started to be different since then . He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way . All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds . Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them . People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones . After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle . During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream . No one was willing to join in . But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle . Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him . After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed . It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined . It was a miracle arising from the ordinary . This is a real story . The postman ' s name is Xue Waller .

After a month at our school , she hadn ' t made any friend . One day at lunch , most tables being full , I had nowhere to sit . Valeri sat alone , book in hand . I walked over to her , \" Is that a good book ? \" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading . \" What ' s it about ? \" I asked . After seconds of silence , she looked at me , her eyes shining , \" Well , it ' s about a dragon ! This boy , Eragon , finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day . He thinks it ' s a rock ! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big . \" Two weeks later , I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show . Then a shy girl walked on stage . I recognized her immediately . Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other . She started to play . The notes formed a soft , sweet tune .

Hiking is fun and exciting , but you shouldn ' t forget safety . Here are some basic tips for successful hiking : 1 . Don ' t hike alone . 2 . Tell someone where you are going ; 3 . Bring water and a good map ; 4 . Watch out for dangers , such as spiders , snakes , or poisonous plants ; 5 . Wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun ; 6 . Bring a mobile phone if you have one . RAFTING Another exciting adventure is rafting . A raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams . Rafting is a good way to experience nature . If you want a normal rafting trip , choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers . The name \" whitewater \" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly . As with hiking , you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes . You also need to learn the basic skills of rafting , such as how to handle the raft , how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft . You should not go rafting unless you know how to swim , and you should always wear a life jacket .", "question": "While you go rafting, you have to   _  .", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun ; 6 .", "As with hiking , you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes .", "The basic equipment you need for hiking is simple : good shoes , clothes and a backpack .", "You should not go rafting unless you know how to swim , and you should always wear a life jacket .", "Hiking is fun and exciting , but you shouldn ' t forget safety .", "Well , many people travel because they want to see other countries and visit places that are famous , interesting or beautiful .", "People also travel to meet new friends , to try new kind of food , to experience life in other parts of the world or simply to get away from cold weather .", "Yet there are other reasons why people travel .", "Many of today ' s travelers are looking for an unusual experience and adventure travel is becoming more and more popular .", "Here is a quick look at two popular activities : hiking and rafting .", "HIKING Hiking is a great way to travel .", "You will get close to nature and take exercise at the same time .", "Hiking is easy to do and doesn ' t have to be very expensive .", "You can hike close to home or travel to other places .", "You can hike in the mountains , in a forest or along a river .", "You can also go for a hike in the city .", "Here are some basic tips for successful hiking : 1 .", "You also need to learn the basic skills of rafting , such as how to handle the raft , how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft .", "Don ' t hike alone .", "2 .", "Tell someone where you are going ; 3 .", "Bring water and a good map ; 4 .", "Watch out for dangers , such as spiders , snakes , or poisonous plants ; 5 .", "Bring a mobile phone if you have one .", "RAFTING Another exciting adventure is rafting .", "A raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams .", "Rafting is a good way to experience nature .", "If you want a normal rafting trip , choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers .", "The name \" whitewater \" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly .", "Why do people travel ?"], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["have rafting skills", "know how to swim", "wear leather shoes", "put on a life jacket."]}, "test/high/10179.txt/0": {"passage": "The chimp didn ' t feel well .

But now it seemed like a fine idea , and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge . \" I read the handbook , too ! \" said a woman behind me , who also let loose over the side of the bridge . We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters . It was quite a sight , but I had other things to occupy my attention , namely the back of Laura ' s sweater . Easing off the bridge , and heading south on Avila Boulevard , Laura and I found our pace together again . Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation . \" You keeping up okay ? \" she asked . Being her older brother , and therefore unable to admit weakness , I nodded convincingly . \" Hey , Lee ! \" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk . Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew , I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie - dyed clothing to a road race of this size . It made it a lot easier to be spotted ! The town marathon is a \" people ' s \" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair , with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere . I managed to run six miles before bowing out , and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours . I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon . The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant . If pressed , however , I ' ll admit that I only ran one - fourth of one . Inspired by this year ' s experience , I plan to walk the course - - really fast - - next year . It ' s not because I ' m jealous of my sister ' s accomplishment . This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does . Rather , Laura got free cookies at the finish line , and the promise of that will lead me to any goal .", "question": "The tone of this passage is best described as   _  .", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Inspired by this year ' s experience , I plan to walk the course - - really fast - - next year .", "Keep going - - go , go , go !", "If pressed , however , I ' ll admit that I only ran one - fourth of one .", "Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew , I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie - dyed clothing to a road race of this size .", "She had been diligently clocking eight - minute miles since the race had begun downtown .", "It was mile 17 of the marathon .", "Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation .", "\" said a woman behind me , who also let loose over the side of the bridge .", "Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her .", "It ' s not because I ' m jealous of my sister ' s accomplishment .", "We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters .", "During my preview of the route , it had seemed like a babyish thing to do .", "But now it seemed like a fine idea , and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge .", "Rather , Laura got free cookies at the finish line , and the promise of that will lead me to any goal .", "It was quite a sight , but I had other things to occupy my attention , namely the back of Laura ' s sweater .", "A group of drummers was beating their drums , chanting , and encouraging us with their music and smiles .", "Initially in the middle of a pack , which was several thousand people , she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so .", "Once we crossed , we would begin heading back into town , running along the east side of the Rincon River .", "\" she asked .", "He clapped loudly .", "I just got started .", "\" You bet I ' m looking strong , I thought , as I followed my younger sister , Laura .", "I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon .", "\" You ' re looking strong .", "\" a bearded viewer yelled to me .", "\" Hey , great stride !", "The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant .", "\" His deep , loud voice boomed toward us .", ".", ".", "\" Two hours , fifteen minutes , forty seconds .", "I managed to run six miles before bowing out , and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours .", "Cecelia Bridge .", "We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St .", "\" You keeping up okay ?", "The town marathon is a \" people ' s \" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair , with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere .", "Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk , and with no experience running in organized events , I figured I might be good for two or three miles .", "Up ahead , steel drums were playing .", "Crossing the bridge , I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook .", "This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does .", "It made it a lot easier to be spotted !", "\" I read the handbook , too !", "\" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk .", "\" Hey , Lee !", "Easing off the bridge , and heading south on Avila Boulevard , Laura and I found our pace together again .", "Being her older brother , and therefore unable to admit weakness , I nodded convincingly .", "The man with the bullhorn encouraged the runners as they made their way up the hill ."], "answer_index": 1, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["tense and anxious", "light and friendly", "matter-of-fact", "uninterested and bored"]}, "test/high/11598.txt/0": {"passage": "People like different kinds of vacations .

Since I have come to China , I have been able to experience these differences first - hand . A whole new world of food has been opened up to me . Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals associated with eating . For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody ' s teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we don ' t like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening ' s meal . I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty . The meal was winding its way along without any problems . Then they brought out the lobster .

For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody ' s teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we don ' t like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening ' s meal .

Countries also use animals as symbols . From eagles to lions , many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character . The image of an eagle is on the US President ' s flag , and on the one - dollar bill . The bald eagle is a large , powerful , brown bird with a white head and tail . The term \" bald \" does not mean that this bird lacks feathers . Instead , it comes from the old word piebald , that menas , \" marked with white \" . The US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782 . It was chosen because of \" its long life , great strength , and noble looks \" . A few eagles have even become American heroes . An eagle named \" Old Abe \" , the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War , traveled 14 , 000 miles with its men . He was often shot at by the enemy , but survived 42 battles . But , one of the Founding Fathers , Benjamin Franklin didn ' t agree with the choice . \" The bald eagle . . . is a bird of bad moral character , like those among men who live by robbing , he is generally poor , and often very messy , \" he argued . Franklin wanted the turkey as the country ' s national bird . If Americans chose their national symbol deliberately , the symbol of England arose out of history . King Herry I ( 1068 - 1135 ) was a brave warrior but also wise . His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice . He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol , which is popularly known as the \" king of the jungle \" . By the year Richard I , known as \" The Lionheart \" for his bravery , came to the throne in 1189 , the famous Three Lions badge had been formed . Now it can be seen on the shirts of England ' s sports teams . Although people might not think of lions when they think of England , everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo . Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers .

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again . Needless to say , when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten . This can have some embarrassing consequences . Five or six years after high school graduation , I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store . I knew him . He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine , we had shared many classes and knew each other well . I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit . I should have known his name . How many times had I heard it during class role call ? How many conversations had we had in the hallways ? I easily remembered his surname , \" Ricca \" . His was a large , well know family in the town of my childhood . I couldn ' t have just _ him using his surname . I might as well have admitted forgetting his name , which was not a choice . One ' s name is important to every person ' s identity . Not remembering an old acquaintance ' s name is similar to forgetting your wife ' s favourite flower , an embarrassing mistake of the highest order . I quickly ran through the alphabet , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion . Abe ? No , Adam , Andy , Bob ? No , Bill ? Yes ! Bill sounded right . Of course , his name is Bill . I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil . \" Bill , how are you doing ? \" , I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake .

Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again . Needless to say , when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten . This can have some embarrassing consequences . Five or six years after high school graduation , I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store . I knew him . He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine , we had shared many classes and knew each other well . I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit . I should have known his name . How many times had I heard it during class role call ? How many conversations had we had in the hallways ? I easily remembered his surname , \" Ricca \" . His was a large , well know family in the town of my childhood . I couldn ' t have just _ him using his surname . I might as well have admitted forgetting his name , which was not a choice . One ' s name is important to every person ' s identity . Not remembering an old acquaintance ' s name is similar to forgetting your wife ' s favourite flower , an embarrassing mistake of the highest order . I quickly ran through the alphabet , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion . Abe ? No , Adam , Andy , Bob ? No , Bill ? Yes ! Bill sounded right . Of course , his name is Bill . I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil . \" Bill , how are you doing ? \" , I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake .

Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture . Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors .

Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors . For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space . Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs . They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers . Age also affects how people use personal space . Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five . As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space . By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances . Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space . For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them . Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side . Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females . The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States . As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex . As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace . Soon , perhaps , cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress . Until then , people need to make a special effort to learn one another ' s expectations concerning personal space . Once people are sensitive to such matters , they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture .", "question": "According to the passage, which fact makes no contribution to the decision of interpersonal     distance?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Age also affects how people use personal space .", "Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five .", "Once people are sensitive to such matters , they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture .", "Hall was a pioneer in the field .", "Those boundaries move with people as they interact .", "Personal space depends on invisible boundaries .", "As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist .", "In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication .", "He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people .", "Anthropologist Edward T .", "People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space .", "Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago .", "Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture .", "Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction .", "Martin had not readjusted to North American distances .", "When most South Americans talk to each other face - to - face , they stand closer together than North Americans do .", "Fairly soon she figured out what was happening .", "People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive , but that was not right .", "Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment .", "As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions .", "Until then , people need to make a special effort to learn one another ' s expectations concerning personal space .", "Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors .", "For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space .", "Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs .", "They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers .", "As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space .", "By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances .", "Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space .", "For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them .", "Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side .", "Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females .", "The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States .", "As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex .", "As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace .", "Soon , perhaps , cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress .", "When she returned home after a year in South America , Judith Martin , a North American writer , began to have a problem ."], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["culture", "gender", "age", "education"]}, "test/high/18574.txt/3": {"passage": "When she returned home after a year in South America , Judith Martin , a North American writer , began to have a problem .

Outdoor sports give children , teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine , which improve their over - all health .

Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity .

Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all . If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports . The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports .

They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun , and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing . Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity . While track and field events may not be some small children ' s cup of tea , there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards . The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time . The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each , for a total of 6 . Eight - year - old Jerel Rhodes II , won gold medals for the shot put , and the discus throw . Seven - year - old Jadyn Rhodes , received a silver medal fro the shot put , and a bronze medal in the 400 - meter race . Five - year - old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800 - meter race , as well as the discuss throw . There is a down side to athletic activities . Not everyone will go home as a winner . If your child does not win a medal , you should not complain about him or her . You should be proud of him or her just for taking part . If a child feels bad about his or her performance , he or she may be teased by other children , or his or her parents may express disappointment . All these can have an effect on self - esteem . The bottom line is to get your children out of the house , and to be involved in activities that keep them moving . Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all . If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports . The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports . Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable , or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them . If you encourage those like the Rhodes family , who have the desire to play sports , they just might bring home a gold , silver or bronze medal .", "question": "What is the main advice that the author gives parents?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Young people who join in after - school sports activities will be out of the house .", "It is true that children used to take part in outdoor sports and games .", "Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable , or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them .", "Outdoor sports give children , teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine , which improve their over - all health .", "Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity .", "There are even sports that young athletes do better in school .", "The bottom line is to get your children out of the house , and to be involved in activities that keep them moving .", "The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports .", "If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports .", "While track and field events may not be some small children ' s cup of tea , there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards .", "It is never too early for young children to compete in athletic activities .", "If you encourage those like the Rhodes family , who have the desire to play sports , they just might bring home a gold , silver or bronze medal .", "Rarely can people see children today , enjoying themselves outdoors , on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods .", "If a child feels bad about his or her performance , he or she may be teased by other children , or his or her parents may express disappointment .", "They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player , whey they are part of an organized sport .", "You should be proud of him or her just for taking part .", "There is a down side to athletic activities .", "The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time .", "The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each , for a total of 6 .", "Five - year - old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800 - meter race , as well as the discuss throw .", "Seven - year - old Jadyn Rhodes , received a silver medal fro the shot put , and a bronze medal in the 400 - meter race .", "It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing .", "They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun , and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity .", "If your child does not win a medal , you should not complain about him or her .", "They also learn about good sportsmanship , teamwork and gaining confidence .", "Not everyone will go home as a winner .", "They will be on the move , running and jumping , which is great exercise .", "All these can have an effect on self - esteem .", "Eight - year - old Jerel Rhodes II , won gold medals for the shot put , and the discus throw .", "Today many young people stay inside watching television , playing computer games , or surfing the Internet .", "Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all ."], "answer_index": 2, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["Making children take advantage of organized competitive sports.", "The earlier children take part in sports activities, the better they are.", "Encouraging their children to join in sports instead of pushing them", "Forcing children to take part in sports activities if they don't want to."]}, "test/high/11964.txt/0": {"passage": "A long time before I was born , my grandma and grandpa had a young family of four little girls .

Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them . So why do they keep eating it ? The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people . However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all . 1 . Fast food makes you fat . A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance . In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes . You probably know this already . But here ' s something you may not know . 2 . Fast food is addictive . The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it . One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations . \" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it . 3 . Fast food is affecting your kids . According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years . Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen . Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly . Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity . 4 . Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them . One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 . 1 to 14 . 8 percent . So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ? Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly . That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad . 5 . Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy . Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options . The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax . One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium . 6 . Fast food is inhumane to animals . Okay , this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you , but it ' s still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food . 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches . Large factory farms resemble more of a \" business \" than a \" farm . \" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight . They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease , which runs rampant in these conditions . Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence , according to the UN . 7 . Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar . High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas , desserts , and many other products . Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study . Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar .", "question": "What is the purpose of the passage?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["So why do they keep eating it ?", "1 to 14 .", "9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches .", "Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options .", "However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all .", "Fast food is inhumane to animals .", "Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen .", "\" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it .", "\" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight .", "Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence , according to the UN .", "Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study .", "A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance .", "They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease , which runs rampant in these conditions .", "According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years .", "Eight in 10 Americans eat fast food at least once a month and half eat it every week according , to a Gallup Poll .", "One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations .", "Okay , this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you , but it ' s still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food .", "Fast food is affecting your kids .", "3 .", "Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them .", "The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people .", "1 .", "The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it .", "Fast food makes you fat .", "2 .", "But here ' s something you may not know .", "You probably know this already .", "In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes .", "Fast food is addictive .", "Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar .", "Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly .", "Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity .", "High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas , desserts , and many other products .", "Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar .", "7 .", "Large factory farms resemble more of a \" business \" than a \" farm .", "6 .", "One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium .", "The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax .", "Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy .", "5 .", "That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad .", "Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly .", "So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ?", "8 percent .", "One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 .", "4 .", "Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them ."], "answer_index": 1, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["To help us make right decisions", "To advise us to stop eating fast food", "To tell us how to keep fit", "To encourage us to be humane to animals"]}, "test/high/13424.txt/0": {"passage": "In a mango orchard outside a village there lived a mischievous monkey .

Your money or your wife ? \" \" Neither , \" he replied , with the satisfied look of a man who knew he was keeping pace with the latest technology , no matter how ridiculous he looked . \" This is what everyone will have soon - - even you . It ' s called a mobile telephone . \" I don ' t feel sorry for the pace of change . On the contrary , I ' m amazed by those high - tech designers who can somehow fit a camera , music - player , computer and phone into a plastic box no bigger than a packet of cigarette . If those geniuses could also find a way to keep the underground trains running on the first snowy day of winter , they would be making real progress for human beings . What I do regret , however , is that so many household items fall behind so soon . My parents bought a wooden wireless radio in 1947 , the year they were married . In 1973 , the year I went to university , it was still working . It sat in the kitchen like an old friend - - which , in a way , it was . It certainly spoke to us more than we spoke to each other on some mornings . When my mum replaced it with a new - style radio that could also play cassette - tapes , I felt a real sense of loss . Such is the over - excited change of 21st - century technology that there ' s no time to satisfy our emotional needs .

This morning I wake up suddenly , like the alarm clock in my head has given me a little electric shock ; it isn ' t sunny outside . I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey . Hearing my brother is getting up , I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea . He ' s down in the kitchen about five minutes later , wearing his work clothes , eyes mostly closed against the morning . \" Morning . \" I say . \" Uh huh . \" I leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room , and get back beneath the quilt . This morning I want to think a while . Today is Dad ' s birthday ; Mom won ' t mention it . My brother might , just to _ , so I ' ll keep him sweet when he comes in from work . Every year on my dad ' s birthday I draw a picture of him ; each year he looks a bit different . I ' m an artist . It ' s not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle , as they try to teach us to do at school . I just get the message across more clearly than other people . More truthfully . I know it . I read a lot of books too , mainly about artists , and I try to paint like them . When my dad comes back I ' ll be able to say \" this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet \" or \" this is you on your thirty - eighth birthday , when I was fourteen , and you ' d been gone five years , and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti . \" And he ' ll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him . On Saturday mornings he ' d take me to town and I ' d drag him around the art shops . On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons . On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel , a real one , not a kiddie ' s . On my ninth birthday he bought me oils . Some mornings I ' d wake up and there ' d be a book on my pillow about Picasso , or Chagall . \" Draw me , \" he ' d say . \" Aw , Dad , I can ' t . \" I know I should go to school ; I ' m not one of those kids who are scared to go . But , it ' s my dad ' s birthday and I think I must spend it with him . So I spend some time thinking about his hair , which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year ; I know hair doesn ' t age at the same speed every year , but I make his hair longer this year . And in my mind ' s eye I give him an extra few pounds too . But I keep the smile fixed in my head , like it is when he ' s happy . It ' s head and shoulders , so I ' ll put him in a T - shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black .

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing . Oliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth . One was an old woman , who was nearly always drunk , and the other was a busy local doctor , who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver ' s survival . _ However , Oliver managed to draw his first breath , and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly . His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered , \" Let me see the child , and die . \" The doctor turned away from the fire , where he had been warming his hands . \" You must not talk about dying yet , \" he said to her kindly . He gave her the child to hold . Lovingly , she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips , then stared wildly around the room , fell back - - and died . \" Poor dear ! \" said the nurse , hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt . The doctor began to put on his coat . \" The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties , \" he said . \" If so , give it a little milk to keep it quiet . \" Then he looked at the dead woman . \" The mother was a good - looking girl . Where did she come from ? \" \" She was brought here last night , \" replied the old woman . \" She was found lying in the street . She ' d walked some distance , judging by her shoes , which were worn to pieces . Where she came from , where she was going to , or what her name was , nobody knows . \" The doctor lifted the girl ' s left hand . \" The old story , \" he said sadly , shaking his head . \" No wedding ring , I see . Ah ! Good night . \" And so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse . Without clothes , under his first blanket , he could have been the child of a king or a beggar . But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes , yellow with age , he looked exactly what he was - - an orphan in a workhouse , ready for a life of misery , hunger , and neglect . Oliver cried loudly . If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan , perhaps he would have cried even more loudly . There was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse , so Oliver was sent to a special \" baby farm \" nearby . There , he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing . Mrs Mann , the old woman who \" looked after \" them , was very experienced . She knew what was good for children , and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health . She also knew what was good for herself , so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children ' s food . The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children , but they always sent the beadle , a kind of local policeman , to announce their visit the day before . So whenever the board arrived , of course , the children were always neat and clean . This was the way Oliver was brought up . Consequently , at the age of nine he was a pale , thin child and short for his age . But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann , his spirit was strong , which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all . On Oliver ' s ninth birthday , Mr Bumble , the beadle , came to the house to see Mrs Mann . Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate , and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her . \" Quick ! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed ! \" she said .

Sorry I haven ' t written for so long . I ' ve been quite busy planning my holiday with may older brother , Coin . Do you still remember the trip I told you about ? I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university . Well , now we ' re ready to go ! We ' re going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things . We will go to Africa first . I can ' t wait ! Have you been there ? We leave London on 15thJuly , and we ' ll be flying toprefix = st1 / Morocco , in Northern Africa . We ' re going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert . It ' s the biggest desert in the world - about the size of The US ! I expect it will be very hot , dry and dusty _ . We ' ll be traveling by camel , with local guides , camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big , thick sleeping bags . I ' ve heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights . I ' ll bring a torch with me so that I ' ll be able to see in the dark . The whole trip will take six days . That means I ' ll have to sit on a came for almost a week - how uncomfortable ! I hope my camel likes me ! After the trip by camel , we ' ve going to travel down the River Nile . We ' ll start at Lake Victoria . A little way down the river from Victoria , the water actually gets quite rough . So , we ' ll go white - water rafting . It ' s quite dangerous , but very exciting ! We have to wear special clothing , a helmet and a life jacket , just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white - water rafting , we ' re going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya . We ' ll live with the local people in their villages , and eat and drink like they do , including cow ' s blood ! Do you think I should drink it ? Since we ' ll be walking every day for almost two weeks , I ' ll need to buy a large , strong , light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water . During the day , we ' ll walk across the land , following the footprints of big animals such as elephants , lions and giraffes . We ' ll try to get as close as possible to the animals , even though they ' re dangerous , so that I can take some really good photos . But don ' t worry about me - - our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close . I really want to see an elephant up close . Colin wants to see a giraffe . After that , we ' ll be moving on to Tanzania , where we ' re going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro . Mountain climbing can be very tiring , and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner , so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset . The African part of our trip will take about four weeks . Then we ' re going to the Himalayas . I ' ll send you postcards from all the different places we visit !
