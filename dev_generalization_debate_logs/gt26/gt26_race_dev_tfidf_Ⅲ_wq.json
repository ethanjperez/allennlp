What ' s worse , he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking . He asked , \" What ' s for dinner , Mom ? \" after he had just eaten . Poor Andrew , he was only 15 ! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor . A brain scan made it clear : Andrew had a malignant brain tumor . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory . He should be operated on as soon as possible . Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor , but Andrew ' s memory was still poor . He was told he would probably never go back to school . Andrew was eager to enter a university , but it seemed that his dream wouldn ' t come true . \" Even though they told me this , I knew I wanted to go back to school , \" Andrew said . \" I wanted to get my memory back . \" Andrew began by auditing an English class at a nearby school .

Sometimes your peers influence you in a _ or unhealthy way . A friend might offer you cigarettes . Cigarettes are harmful to your health . Your friend knows that . Your friend also knows that underage smoking is against the law . Yet he or she still makes the offer . This bad influence is negative peer pressure .

He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones . How magnificent it will be ! His ordinary life started to be different since then . He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way . All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds . Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them . People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones . After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle . During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream . No one was willing to join in . But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle . Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him . After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed . It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined . It was a miracle arising from the ordinary . This is a real story . The postman ' s name is Xue Waller . The stone castle has become a famous tourist attraction in France , which is called \" ideal palace of Ferdinand Cheval . \" At the entrance of the stone castle , there is a sentence - - \" I want to know how far a dream stone can go . \"", "question": "From the passage we can learn that   _  .", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["It was a little stone that tripped him up .", "The postman then placed the stone in his bag carefully .", "In his eyes , this stone was like a lost jewel covered with dust .", "He was just an ordinary postman .", "The postman ' s name is Xue Waller .", "\" At the entrance of the stone castle , there is a sentence - - \" I want to know how far a dream stone can go .", "After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed .", "But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle .", "This is a real story .", "He observed the stone that had embarrassed him , finding it strange but beautiful .", "People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones .", "Because of this stone ' s arrival , his day was lightened .", "He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way .", "The stone castle has become a famous tourist attraction in France , which is called \" ideal palace of Ferdinand Cheval .", "It was a miracle arising from the ordinary .", "When he looked up in the sky , he suddenly lost his balance .", "For him , life was without waves .", "No one was willing to join in .", "It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined .", "He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones .", "Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him .", "One day , he was delivering mail as usual .", "During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream .", "Day after day , he shuttled back and forth across the village .", "Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them .", "His ordinary life started to be different since then .", "After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle .", "All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds .", "How magnificent it will be !", "\""], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["The postman had a colourful life before the accident in which he lost his balance.", "The postman gave up his job in order to built his stone castle.", "The stone that tripped the postman up was a real jewel.", "Though people didn't understand him, the postman continued his dream-building a castle."]}, "test/middle/6928.txt/0": {"passage": "Are you the type of person who easily gets less confident by negative advice ?

After a month at our school , she hadn ' t made any friend . One day at lunch , most tables being full , I had nowhere to sit . Valeri sat alone , book in hand . I walked over to her , \" Is that a good book ? \" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading . \" What ' s it about ? \" I asked . After seconds of silence , she looked at me , her eyes shining , \" Well , it ' s about a dragon ! This boy , Eragon , finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day . He thinks it ' s a rock ! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big . \" Two weeks later , I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show . Then a shy girl walked on stage . I recognized her immediately . Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other . She started to play . The notes formed a soft , sweet tune .

Mallard suffered from a heart trouble , great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband ' s death . It was her sister Josephine who told her , in broken sentences . Her husband ' s friend Richards was there , too . It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received , with Brently Mallard ' s name leading the list of \" killed . \" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram , and hurried to send the sad message . She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same . She wept at once , with wild abandonment , in her sister ' s arms . When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone . There stood , facing the open window , a comfortable armchair . Into this she sank , pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul . She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life . The delicious breath of rain was in the air . The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her , and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves . There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it , fearfully . What was it ? It was too hard to name . But she felt it , coming out of the sky , reaching toward her through the sounds , the smells , the color that filled the air . Now her chest rose and fell violently . She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her , and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips . She said it over and over under the breath : \" free , free , free ! \" She did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her . She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind , gentle hands folded in death ; the face that had never looked at her except with love , fixed and gray and dead . But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely . And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome . There would be no one to live for during those coming years ; she would live for herself . There would be no powerful will bending hers . And yet she had loved him - - sometimes . What did it matter ! What could love count for in the face of her realization . \" Free ! Body and soul free ! \" she kept whispering . Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole . \" Louise , open the door ! I beg ; open the door - - you will make yourself ill . \" \" Go away . I am not making myself ill . \" Her fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her , all sorts of days that would be her own . She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long . It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long . She arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister ' s begging . She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory . She held her sister ' s waist , and together they walked down the stairs . Someone was opening the front door with a key . It was Brently Mallard who entered , a little travel - stained , calmly carrying his suitcase and umbrella .

Mallard suffered from a heart trouble , great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband ' s death . It was her sister Josephine who told her , in broken sentences . Her husband ' s friend Richards was there , too . It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received , with Brently Mallard ' s name leading the list of \" killed . \" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram , and hurried to send the sad message . She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same . She wept at once , with wild abandonment , in her sister ' s arms . When the storm of sadness had spent itself she went away to her room alone . There stood , facing the open window , a comfortable armchair . Into this she sank , pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul . She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life . The delicious breath of rain was in the air . The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her , and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves . There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it , fearfully . What was it ? It was too hard to name . But she felt it , coming out of the sky , reaching toward her through the sounds , the smells , the color that filled the air . Now her chest rose and fell violently . She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her , and _ When she gave up trying a little whispered word escaped her lips . She said it over and over under the breath : \" free , free , free ! \" She did not stop to ask if it was extreme joy that held her . She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind , gentle hands folded in death ; the face that had never looked at her except with love , fixed and gray and dead . But she saw beyond that bitter moment many years to come that would belong to her absolutely . And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome . There would be no one to live for during those coming years ; she would live for herself . There would be no powerful will bending hers . And yet she had loved him - - sometimes . What did it matter ! What could love count for in the face of her realization . \" Free ! Body and soul free ! \" she kept whispering . Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole . \" Louise , open the door ! I beg ; open the door - - you will make yourself ill . \" \" Go away . I am not making myself ill . \" Her fancy was running wild along those days ahead of her , all sorts of days that would be her own . She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long . It was only yesterday she had thought with a shake that life might be long . She arose after a long time and opened the door to her sister ' s begging . She carried herself unknowingly like a goddess of Victory . She held her sister ' s waist , and together they walked down the stairs . Someone was opening the front door with a key .

First of all , transport should be much better . At present , our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars - - it takes months . However , by 2100 , spaceship can travel at half the speed of light . It might take us two or three days to get to Mars ! Secondly , humans need food , water and air to live . Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars . These plants will produce the food and air that we need . However , can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now . There is a problem for us to live on Mars . Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does . This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space . To prevent this , humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier . Life on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways , People will have more space . Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible . Many people believe that robot will do most of our work , so we have more time for our hobbies . There will probably be no school on Mars . Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet . They can study , do their homework and take exams in online schools .

Volunteers need ski sixteen kilometers every day . - Do you enjoy ocean animals ? You can spend two to four weeks in Hawaii . There , you can teach language to dolphins . Dolphins can follow orders such as \" Bring me the large ball \" . They also understand opposites . How much more can they understand ? It will be exciting to learn about these _ animals . Another study trip goes to Washington State and follows orcas . We call orcas \" Killer Whale \" , but they ' re really dolphins - - the largest kind of dolphin . . These beautiful animals travel together in family groups . They move through the ocean with their mothers , grandmothers and great - grandmothers . Ocean pollution is chasing their lives . Earthwatch is studying how this happens . Are you interested in history ? Then Greece is the place for your adventure . Thirty - five hundred years ago a volcano exploded there , on Santorini . This explosion was more terrible than Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens . But today we know a lot about the way of life of the people from that time . There are houses , kitchens , and paintings as interesting as those in Pompei . Today teams of volunteers are learning more about people from the past . Do you want a very different vacation ? Do you want to travel far , work hard and learn a lot ?

But the words , Carl Walter spoke that day , came back to me years later , and ever since have been of great value to me . Carl Walter was my piano teacher . During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I was doing . I said three or four hours a day . \" Do you practice in long _ , an hour at a time ? \" \" I try to . \" \" Well , don ' t , \" he said loudly . \" When you grow up , time won ' t come in long stretches . Practice in minutes , whenever you can find them five or ten before school , after lunch , between household tasks . Spread the practice through the day , and piano - playing will become a part of your life . \" When I was teaching at Columbia , I wanted to write , but class periods , theme - reading , and committee meetings filled my days and evenings . For two years I got practically nothing down on paper , and my excuse was that I had no time . Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said . During the next week I conducted an experiment . Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied , I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so . To my astonishment , at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision . Later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method . Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever , in every day there were moments which could be caught and put to use . There is an important trick in this time - using principle : you must get into your work quickly . If you have but five minutes for writing , you can ' t afford to waste it in chewing your pencil . You must make your mental preparations beforehand , and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes . Fortunately , rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize .

By the time I arrived , the charming paradise had been deserted because miners ' good luck didn ' t last . Then , I realized I was not alone after all . A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house . Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers . White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind . Still smiling , the man invited me inside . My spirit seemed to come to life again . I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor . And on little tables there were seashells , books and china vases full of flowers . A woman had made this house into a home . The joy in my heart showed on my face . The man read my thoughts . \" All her work . \" He said affectionately , \" Nothing here hasn ' t felt the touch of her hand . \" One picture on the wall was not hanging straight . He went to fix it . He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight . Then he gave it a gentle touch . \" She always does that , \" he explained , \" It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child ' s hair after she has brushed it . I don ' t know why I do it . I just do it . \" As he talked , I went to a little black - walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen . There was a sweetness and softness in the woman ' s expression . The man stared at the picture . \" Nineteen her last birthday . That was the day we married . When you see her . . . ah , just wait until you meet her ! \" \" Where is she now ? \" I asked . \" Oh , she is away visiting her parents . This is Wednesday , \" he said slowly . \" She will be back on Saturday , in the evening . \" That night , I stayed . The man told me his name was Henry . Thursday evening we had two visitors , Tom and Joe . \" We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home . Any news from her ? \" \" Oh yes , \" the man replied . \" A letter . \" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it . It was full of loving messages . While reading , he glimpsed his friends and cried out , \" Oh no , you are doing it again , Tom ! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes .

I never found enough to make a rich strike . But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau . Like Heaven on Earth , it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees . By the time I arrived , the charming paradise had been deserted because miners ' good luck didn ' t last . Then , I realized I was not alone after all . A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house . Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers . White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind . Still smiling , the man invited me inside . My spirit seemed to come to life again . I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor . And on little tables there were seashells , books and china vases full of flowers . A woman had made this house into a home . The joy in my heart showed on my face . The man read my thoughts . \" All her work . \" He said affectionately , \" Nothing here hasn ' t felt the touch of her hand . \" One picture on the wall was not hanging straight . He went to fix it . He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight . Then he gave it a gentle touch . \" She always does that , \" he explained , \" It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child ' s hair after she has brushed it . I don ' t know why I do it . I just do it . \" As he talked , I went to a little black - walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen . There was a sweetness and softness in the woman ' s expression . The man stared at the picture . \" Nineteen her last birthday . That was the day we married . When you see her . . . ah , just wait until you meet her ! \" \" Where is she now ? \" I asked . \" Oh , she is away visiting her parents . This is Wednesday , \" he said slowly . \" She will be back on Saturday , in the evening . \" That night , I stayed . The man told me his name was Henry . Thursday evening we had two visitors , Tom and Joe . \" We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home . Any news from her ? \" \" Oh yes , \" the man replied . \" A letter . \" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it . It was full of loving messages . While reading , he glimpsed his friends and cried out , \" Oh no , you are doing it again , Tom ! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes . I ' m going to tell her this time ! \" \" No , you mustn ' t do that , Henry , \" the grey - haired miner said . \" I am getting old . And any little sorrow makes me cry . Lord , we miss her so . \" Saturday finally came . I was glad to see his two friends , Tom and Joe , with guitars , coming down the road as the sun began to set . They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs . Henry ' s friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey . When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses , Tom stopped my arm . \" Drop that ! Take the other . \" he whispered . I did so . Henry was served last . He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight . His face grew paler and paler . \" Boys , \" he said , \" I am sick with fear . Help ! I want to lie down . \" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth . In a moment , those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed . They seemed to be getting ready to leave . So I said , \" Please don ' t go , gentlemen . She won ' t know me . I am a stranger . \" They glanced at each other . Then Joe said , \" She ? Poor thing , she ' s been dead nineteen years ! \" \" Dead ? \" I whispered . \" That or worse . \" he said . \" She went to see her folks half a year after she got married .

It ' s time for the arctic ground squirrel to get her underground home ready . She chooses a quiet spot , hidden from wolves and foxes . She gathers grass and fur to keep her home warm . Winter is long and cold in northern Canada . Many days , the air is colder than the air in your freezer . Plants can ' t grow , so there are no leaves or grass for animals to eat . They must find other ways to live . The arctic ground squirrel \" sleeps \" the winter away . For months the ground squirrel has been eating lots of seeds , mushrooms , and berries . Now she is fat . The extra fat will keep her alive through the winter . At last she crawls through a tunnel into the nest she has made . She curls up , wraps her tail around herself , and goes to \" sleep \" . Only she won ' t really be sleeping . She will be hibernating . The ground squirrel ' s body is usually as warm as yours . When she hibernates , her body becomes just colder than ice , but she doesn ' t freeze . In the warm season , when the ground squirrel is active , she uses most of the food she eats to make heat to stay warm . When she hibernates , she doesn ' t need much food . Her heart beats just one or two times each minute . She will take only about three breaths each minute . She won ' t move , even if someone touches her or shines a light into her eyes . These changes in the ground squirrel ' s body let her live through the winter . The ground squirrel will not stay in hibernation all winter . Her body warms up and becomes active for a few hours once every few weeks . Over the winter , these active times use up more than half of the energy that she worked so hard to store .

Depending on the year of your birth , each person has an animal for a sign . That ' s why I am a pig and my wife is a dragon . If you , like me , were born in the year of the pig , then you are brave , thoughtful and loyal . The year of the pig is filled with good fortune . Now let ' s take a closer look at this interesting animal . Pigs were first raised by man about 9 , 000 years ago , and are still a very common farm animal in many parts of the world . We don ' t just use pigs for their meat - - almost every part of the animal is used . The hair is used for artists ' brushes . The fat is used to make floor wax , rubber and plastics . Pigs have also been important in the world of entertainment . In 1995 the film ' Babe ' starred a loveable talking pig as its main character . The film won an Oscar and was nominated for 6 more . In England you can even go to watch pig racing . A farmer , Rob Shepherd , has been raising money for charity by holding pig races on his farm . The events have been very successful . People don ' t just want to eat pigs , it seems ! Pigs also play an important role in the English language . For example , if someone says that he will travel to the sun one day , you can say \" _ ! \" to him . Hungry ? Well then , you can \" pig out \" and eat lots of food . And what if someone rescues you ?

People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive , but that was not right . Fairly soon she figured out what was happening . When most South Americans talk to each other face - to - face , they stand closer together than North Americans do . Martin had not readjusted to North American distances . Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction . Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture . Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors . For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space . Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs . They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers . Age also affects how people use personal space . Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five . As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space . By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances . Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space . For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them . Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side . Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females . The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States . As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex . As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace .

Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them . So why do they keep eating it ? The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people . However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all . 1 . Fast food makes you fat . A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance . In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes . You probably know this already . But here ' s something you may not know . 2 . Fast food is addictive . The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it . One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations . \" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it . 3 . Fast food is affecting your kids . According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years . Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen . Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly . Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity . 4 . Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them . One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 . 1 to 14 . 8 percent . So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ? Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly . That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad . 5 . Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy . Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options . The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax . One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium . 6 .

Now I am thirty two . I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is . It would be wonderful to see again , but a calamity can do strange things to people . It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn ' t been blind . I believe in life now . I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply , otherwise . I don ' t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes . I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left . Life , I believe , asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality . The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments , the more meaningful his own private world becomes . The adjustment is never easy . I was totally confused and afraid . But I was lucky . My parents and my teachers saw something in me - - a potential to live , you might call it - - which I didn ' t see , and they made me want to fight it out with blindness . The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself . That was basic . If I hadn ' t been able to do that , I would have collapsed and _ for the rest of my life . When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone . That is part of it . But I mean something bigger than that : an assurance that I am , despite imperfections , a real , positive person ; that somewhere in the sweeping , intricate pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit . It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance . It had to start with the simplest things . Once a man gave me an indoor baseball . I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt . \" I can ' t use this . \" I said . \" Take it with you , \" he urged me , \" and roll it around . \" The words stuck in my head . \" Roll it around ! \" By rolling the ball I could hear where it went . This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible : playing baseball . At Philadelphia ' s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball . We called it ground ball . All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them , one at a time . I had to learn my limitations .

My mind told me I was giving false encouragement . I reached the instructor ' s schedule and gave the rates , the available time and the additional information that he would need .

Slow food is an international movement . It promotes home cooking , and the use of fresh , unprocessed produce . It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food . It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses , rather than large supermarkets . The movement began in 1986 . at that time , McDonald ' s wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome ( Italy ) . Food writer Carlo Perini , along with others , was against this . So , the Slow Food Organization was born . Today , it has overt 100 , 00 members in 132 countries . And its symbol is one of the world ' s slowest moving creatures , the snail . The organization ' s website explains , \" The snail was chosen because it moves slowly , and calmly eats its way through life . \" But Slow Food isn ' t just about the food we eat . It ' s also about how we eat it . Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time , we ' ve forgotten that eating should be a social activity . They believe families should eat together and talk , rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it . In fact , research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table , they are more likely to do well in school , and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders . And there ' s more ! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement . This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives . And now , within the movement , there ' s Slow Money , Slow Travel , Slow Parenting , Slow Art and Slow Media , among many others . In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed . One of the Institute ' s slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West . She said , \" Everything worth doing in life , is worth doing slowly . \" Do you agree ?

But 20 years is also long enough for a man to grow up . It is always painful . For Andrew Agassi , maturing in the spotlight of international tennis competition was even harder . On September 3 , the American tennis player said a tearful goodbye to his 21 - year career after a third - round defeat in the US Open . The 36 - year - old tried his best , but was unable to keep up with German Benjamin Becker , _ \" The scoreboard said I lost today , but what the scoreboard doesn ' t say is what I ' ve found , \" Agassi said to the fans . \" I have found inspiration and you willed me to succeed . \" It was an emotional speech at the end of a long career . Agassi hated tennis as a teenager as much as he loves it now . His father made him play when he was a child . He got bored , and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle . He grew hair long , wore colorful clothes and spat at a judge . Over the years , he has made bad jokes during news conferences . Asked what he would say to his 17 - year - old self , Agassi answered , \" I would say , I understand you a lot more than I want to be you . \" The turning point in Agassi ' s career came in 1992 when he unexpectedly won his first Grand Slam at Wimbledon . It was the first time Agassi understood what real champions finally understand : winning is a test of courage and not just power , it ' s a marathon , not a sprint .

Children as young as five years old often give brief talks about objects they bring in to school - called \" show and tell , \" and this training is a basis for later public speaking . Even so , many native English - speaking adults are afraid to speak or give presentations in front of a large group . Speaking English in public meetings is necessary for many students and employees . The best way to improve is to practice public speaking in a friendly environment . Learners need to receive feedback about what they are doing well and about their mistakes . One group that gives members the chance to practice is Toastmasters . Toastmasters is an international organization that holds weekly meetings . At the meetings , members each give a speech and give others advice about their speeches and speaking style . Charles LeBeau is a public speaking professor and consultant . He began his career in Japan in 1982 . Currently , he teaches at two universities and at the Toshiba International Training Center . He has also written books on the subject . English language learners around the world use his book Speaking of Speech . Speaking of Speech tells about a method of teaching public speaking for non - native speakers . Mr . LeBeau says a simple approach helps English learners . \" The approach that I ' ve taken is to simplify and break it down . First if we look at a presentation , what ' s going on , there are basically three messages that the presenter is giving the audience , all simultaneously .

I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university . Well , now we ' re ready to go ! We ' re going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things . We will go to Africa first . I can ' t wait ! Have you been there ? We leave London on 15thJuly , and we ' ll be flying toprefix = st1 / Morocco , in Northern Africa . We ' re going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert . It ' s the biggest desert in the world - about the size of The US ! I expect it will be very hot , dry and dusty _ . We ' ll be traveling by camel , with local guides , camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big , thick sleeping bags . I ' ve heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights . I ' ll bring a torch with me so that I ' ll be able to see in the dark . The whole trip will take six days . That means I ' ll have to sit on a came for almost a week - how uncomfortable ! I hope my camel likes me ! After the trip by camel , we ' ve going to travel down the River Nile . We ' ll start at Lake Victoria . A little way down the river from Victoria , the water actually gets quite rough . So , we ' ll go white - water rafting . It ' s quite dangerous , but very exciting ! We have to wear special clothing , a helmet and a life jacket , just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white - water rafting , we ' re going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya . We ' ll live with the local people in their villages , and eat and drink like they do , including cow ' s blood ! Do you think I should drink it ? Since we ' ll be walking every day for almost two weeks , I ' ll need to buy a large , strong , light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water . During the day , we ' ll walk across the land , following the footprints of big animals such as elephants , lions and giraffes . We ' ll try to get as close as possible to the animals , even though they ' re dangerous , so that I can take some really good photos . But don ' t worry about me - - our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close . I really want to see an elephant up close . Colin wants to see a giraffe . After that , we ' ll be moving on to Tanzania , where we ' re going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro . Mountain climbing can be very tiring , and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner , so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset .
