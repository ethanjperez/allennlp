What ' s worse , he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking . He asked , \" What ' s for dinner , Mom ? \" after he had just eaten . Poor Andrew , he was only 15 ! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor . A brain scan made it clear : Andrew had a malignant brain tumor . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory . He should be operated on as soon as possible . Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor , but Andrew ' s memory was still poor . He was told he would probably never go back to school . Andrew was eager to enter a university , but it seemed that his dream wouldn ' t come true . \" Even though they told me this , I knew I wanted to go back to school , \" Andrew said . \" I wanted to get my memory back . \" Andrew began by auditing an English class at a nearby school .

Sometimes your peers influence you in a _ or unhealthy way . A friend might offer you cigarettes . Cigarettes are harmful to your health . Your friend knows that . Your friend also knows that underage smoking is against the law . Yet he or she still makes the offer . This bad influence is negative peer pressure .

He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones . How magnificent it will be ! His ordinary life started to be different since then . He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way . All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds . Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them . People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones . After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle . During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream . No one was willing to join in . But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle . Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him . After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed . It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined . It was a miracle arising from the ordinary . This is a real story . The postman ' s name is Xue Waller . The stone castle has become a famous tourist attraction in France , which is called \" ideal palace of Ferdinand Cheval . \" At the entrance of the stone castle , there is a sentence - - \" I want to know how far a dream stone can go . \"", "question": "From the passage we can learn that   _  .", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["When he looked up in the sky , he suddenly lost his balance .", "People didn ' t understand what happened when they saw the postman delivering letters with a wheelbarrow full of stones .", "He observed the stone that had embarrassed him , finding it strange but beautiful .", "During the daytime , he passed along the dreams of others ; and during the nighttime , he built his own dream .", "The postman then placed the stone in his bag carefully .", "He still delivered mail , but he collected every stone he could find along the way .", "After 20 years of working day and night , the postman ' s dream castle was finally completed .", "In his eyes , this stone was like a lost jewel covered with dust .", "Because of this stone ' s arrival , his day was lightened .", "His ordinary life started to be different since then .", "Because he knew , the dream and the castle only belonged to him .", "But the postman was unmoved , still happily building his castle .", "One day , he was delivering mail as usual .", "It was a little stone that tripped him up .", "Gradually , his small bag couldn ' t hold his stones anymore and he needed to use a wheelbarrow to carry them .", "He suddenly had a bold thought - - I can build a castle with such beautiful stones .", "He was just an ordinary postman .", "It was a miracle arising from the ordinary .", "It was a magnificent castle just as he had imagined .", "\" At the entrance of the stone castle , there is a sentence - - \" I want to know how far a dream stone can go .", "For him , life was without waves .", "Day after day , he shuttled back and forth across the village .", "After collecting enough stones , he started to build his castle .", "The stone castle has become a famous tourist attraction in France , which is called \" ideal palace of Ferdinand Cheval .", "This is a real story .", "All those dusty stones , in his eyes , glittered like diamonds .", "The postman ' s name is Xue Waller .", "No one was willing to join in .", "How magnificent it will be !", "\""], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["The postman had a colourful life before the accident in which he lost his balance.", "The postman gave up his job in order to built his stone castle.", "The stone that tripped the postman up was a real jewel.", "Though people didn't understand him, the postman continued his dream-building a castle."]}, "test/middle/6928.txt/0": {"passage": "Are you the type of person who easily gets less confident by negative advice ?

After a month at our school , she hadn ' t made any friend . One day at lunch , most tables being full , I had nowhere to sit . Valeri sat alone , book in hand . I walked over to her , \" Is that a good book ? \" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading . \" What ' s it about ? \" I asked . After seconds of silence , she looked at me , her eyes shining , \" Well , it ' s about a dragon ! This boy , Eragon , finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day . He thinks it ' s a rock ! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big . \" Two weeks later , I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show . Then a shy girl walked on stage . I recognized her immediately . Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other . She started to play . The notes formed a soft , sweet tune .

All I could think was : \" Oh no , that swig ! \" I pulled over and waited for him to come to my door . It felt like forever . \" Can I see your license and registration , please , Miss ? \" I gave them to him . He took them and went back to his car for a while . When he returned , he asked if I had been drinking . \" No , \" I said . He asked me to step out of my car . \" Walk heel to toe down the white line , please . \" I passed the test . Next he had me stand on my left foot , lift my right foot and hold it for 30 seconds .

Hiking is fun and exciting , but you shouldn ' t forget safety . Here are some basic tips for successful hiking : 1 . Don ' t hike alone . 2 . Tell someone where you are going ; 3 . Bring water and a good map ; 4 . Watch out for dangers , such as spiders , snakes , or poisonous plants ; 5 . Wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun ; 6 . Bring a mobile phone if you have one . RAFTING Another exciting adventure is rafting . A raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams . Rafting is a good way to experience nature . If you want a normal rafting trip , choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers . The name \" whitewater \" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly . As with hiking , you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes . You also need to learn the basic skills of rafting , such as how to handle the raft , how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft .

But now it seemed like a fine idea , and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge . \" I read the handbook , too ! \" said a woman behind me , who also let loose over the side of the bridge . We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters . It was quite a sight , but I had other things to occupy my attention , namely the back of Laura ' s sweater . Easing off the bridge , and heading south on Avila Boulevard , Laura and I found our pace together again . Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation . \" You keeping up okay ? \" she asked . Being her older brother , and therefore unable to admit weakness , I nodded convincingly . \" Hey , Lee ! \" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk . Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew , I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie - dyed clothing to a road race of this size . It made it a lot easier to be spotted ! The town marathon is a \" people ' s \" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair , with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere . I managed to run six miles before bowing out , and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours . I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon . The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant . If pressed , however , I ' ll admit that I only ran one - fourth of one . Inspired by this year ' s experience , I plan to walk the course - - really fast - - next year . It ' s not because I ' m jealous of my sister ' s accomplishment . This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does . Rather , Laura got free cookies at the finish line , and the promise of that will lead me to any goal .", "question": "The tone of this passage is best described as   _  .", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Being her older brother , and therefore unable to admit weakness , I nodded convincingly .", "But now it seemed like a fine idea , and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge .", "Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk , and with no experience running in organized events , I figured I might be good for two or three miles .", "It was quite a sight , but I had other things to occupy my attention , namely the back of Laura ' s sweater .", "Easing off the bridge , and heading south on Avila Boulevard , Laura and I found our pace together again .", "During my preview of the route , it had seemed like a babyish thing to do .", "Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew , I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie - dyed clothing to a road race of this size .", "Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her .", "The town marathon is a \" people ' s \" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair , with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere .", "Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation .", "\" said a woman behind me , who also let loose over the side of the bridge .", "A group of drummers was beating their drums , chanting , and encouraging us with their music and smiles .", "I managed to run six miles before bowing out , and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours .", "Rather , Laura got free cookies at the finish line , and the promise of that will lead me to any goal .", "Initially in the middle of a pack , which was several thousand people , she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so .", "\" His deep , loud voice boomed toward us .", "\" You bet I ' m looking strong , I thought , as I followed my younger sister , Laura .", "Once we crossed , we would begin heading back into town , running along the east side of the Rincon River .", "\" a bearded viewer yelled to me .", "The man with the bullhorn encouraged the runners as they made their way up the hill .", "I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon .", "We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St .", "Up ahead , steel drums were playing .", "The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant .", "Crossing the bridge , I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook .", "If pressed , however , I ' ll admit that I only ran one - fourth of one .", "She had been diligently clocking eight - minute miles since the race had begun downtown .", "It made it a lot easier to be spotted !", "It ' s not because I ' m jealous of my sister ' s accomplishment .", "Inspired by this year ' s experience , I plan to walk the course - - really fast - - next year .", "\" I read the handbook , too !", "This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does .", "\" You ' re looking strong .", "We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters .", "\" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk .", "He clapped loudly .", "It was mile 17 of the marathon .", "\" Two hours , fifteen minutes , forty seconds .", "I just got started .", "\" Hey , great stride !", "\" she asked .", "Keep going - - go , go , go !", "\" You keeping up okay ?", "\" Hey , Lee !", "Cecelia Bridge .", ".", "."], "answer_index": 1, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["tense and anxious", "light and friendly", "matter-of-fact", "uninterested and bored"]}, "test/high/11598.txt/0": {"passage": "People like different kinds of vacations .

Since I have come to China , I have been able to experience these differences first - hand . A whole new world of food has been opened up to me . Along with these new experiences came the quite unexpected introduction to the rituals associated with eating . For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody ' s teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we don ' t like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening ' s meal . I hesitated at the scorpions , but swallowed my distaste and indeed found later that they were tasty . The meal was winding its way along without any problems . Then they brought out the lobster .

For example , shortly after arriving , I was gently criticized for filling somebody ' s teacup all the way up instead of half way . This was a signal to the person that I desired that he leave . There may be mixed messages about what it means when you do something associated with food . But the fact is that there may be a message contained in the preparation , serving and consumption of food in China . This was an idea that was totally new to me ! More than one Chinese has made the comment to me that they were unhappy with the results of inviting a foreigner to a meal . They told me that the foreigner was not appreciative of the meal that was served to him or her and was hard to please . Having played the part of the foreigner at more than one Chinese _ , I can understand where the misunderstandings come from . I myself have felt very uncomfortable during some of the dinners I have been invited to . One time I was invited to a dinner in a famous restaurant in Tianjin . Its menu was based on seafood . I was still ly new to the concept that your fish would be brought live to your table . In Canada you are never introduced to your meal before hand . Something we don ' t like is considering what our food looks before the actual consumption . However , having been in China for one year , I went along and helped point out some of the selections for the evening ' s meal .

Countries also use animals as symbols . From eagles to lions , many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character . The image of an eagle is on the US President ' s flag , and on the one - dollar bill . The bald eagle is a large , powerful , brown bird with a white head and tail . The term \" bald \" does not mean that this bird lacks feathers . Instead , it comes from the old word piebald , that menas , \" marked with white \" . The US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782 . It was chosen because of \" its long life , great strength , and noble looks \" . A few eagles have even become American heroes . An eagle named \" Old Abe \" , the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War , traveled 14 , 000 miles with its men . He was often shot at by the enemy , but survived 42 battles . But , one of the Founding Fathers , Benjamin Franklin didn ' t agree with the choice . \" The bald eagle . . . is a bird of bad moral character , like those among men who live by robbing , he is generally poor , and often very messy , \" he argued . Franklin wanted the turkey as the country ' s national bird . If Americans chose their national symbol deliberately , the symbol of England arose out of history . King Herry I ( 1068 - 1135 ) was a brave warrior but also wise . His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice . He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol , which is popularly known as the \" king of the jungle \" . By the year Richard I , known as \" The Lionheart \" for his bravery , came to the throne in 1189 , the famous Three Lions badge had been formed . Now it can be seen on the shirts of England ' s sports teams . Although people might not think of lions when they think of England , everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo . Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers .

He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine , we had shared many classes and knew each other well . I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit . I should have known his name . How many times had I heard it during class role call ? How many conversations had we had in the hallways ? I easily remembered his surname , \" Ricca \" . His was a large , well know family in the town of my childhood . I couldn ' t have just _ him using his surname . I might as well have admitted forgetting his name , which was not a choice . One ' s name is important to every person ' s identity .

In each clearing was a village with fields of crops around it . The Maya planted seeds after they cleared the land . A farmer was able to grow crops that produced for several people . But not every Maya had to be a farmer . Some were builders or priests . The Maya believed in many gods . They built large temples to honor them . Skillful workers built cities around these temples .

The other people lived in small villages in the forests . Their houses were much simpler . Most Maya lived a simple life close to nature .

When most South Americans talk to each other face - to - face , they stand closer together than North Americans do . Martin had not readjusted to North American distances . Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction . Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture . Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors . For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space . Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs .

Age also affects how people use personal space . Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five . As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space . By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances . Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space . For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them . Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side . Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females . The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States . As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex .

Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction . Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture . Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago . Anthropologist Edward T . Hall was a pioneer in the field . He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people . In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication . As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist . Personal space depends on invisible boundaries . Those boundaries move with people as they interact . Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment . People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space . As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions . Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors . For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space . Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs . They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers . Age also affects how people use personal space . Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five . As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space . By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances . Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space . For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them . Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side . Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females . The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States . As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex . As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace . Soon , perhaps , cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress . Until then , people need to make a special effort to learn one another ' s expectations concerning personal space . Once people are sensitive to such matters , they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture .", "question": "According to the passage, which fact makes no contribution to the decision of interpersonal     distance?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Soon , perhaps , cultural differences in expectations for personal space will be as familiar to everyone as are cultural differences in food and dress .", "Fisher , Bell , and Baum report that groups of Hispanic - Americans generally interact more closely within their subculture than Anglo - Americans do within theirs .", "By the time they reach puberty , they have completely adapted to their culture ' s standards for interpersonal distances .", "As international travel and commerce increase , intercultural contact is becoming commonplace .", "Everyone has expectations concerning the use of personal space , but accepted distances for that space are determined by each person ' s culture .", "For example , subcultures help determine expectations concerning personal space .", "Gender also influences people ' s use of personal space .", "They further explain that in general subcultural groups tend to interact at closer distances with members of their own subculture than with nonmembers .", "Once people are sensitive to such matters , they will not go either away from or toward a person from another culture .", "Apparently , she had forgotten about the phenomenon known as personal space - - the amount of physical distance people expect during social interaction .", "Age also affects how people use personal space .", "He became very interested in how interpersonal distances affected communication between people .", "In his book The Hidden Dimension , Hall invented the word \" proxemics \" to describe people ' s use of space as a means of communication .", "As Maines observes , when people have some choice about where they stand or sit in crowded settings , they choose people of the same sex .", "As Cooper explains , invasions of personal space bring about negative reactions .", "The gender factor changes , however , in high - density situations such as crowded subways or elevators in the United States .", "For example , North American males ' most negative reaction is reserved for anyone who enters their personal space directly in front of them .", "Until then , people need to make a special effort to learn one another ' s expectations concerning personal space .", "As Hall ' s book title indicates , most people are unconscious that interpersonal distances exist .", "Cooper reports that North American children seem unaware of boundaries for personal space until the age of four or five .", "As the children get older they become more aware of standards for personal space .", "Personal space gets larger or smaller depending on the circumstances of the social interaction at any moment .", "When she returned home after a year in South America , Judith Martin , a North American writer , began to have a problem .", "Researchers working with Hall ' s data found that accepted interpersonal distances in the United States also depend on other factors .", "Personal space depends on invisible boundaries .", "Also , females have smaller interpersonal distances than males do , although pairs of the same sex communicate across larger spaces than do pairs of males and females .", "Females , on the other hand , feel most negative about approaches from the side .", "People kept interpreting her behavior as aggressive , but that was not right .", "Those boundaries move with people as they interact .", "When most South Americans talk to each other face - to - face , they stand closer together than North Americans do .", "People do not like anyone to trespass on their personal space .", "Hall was a pioneer in the field .", "Martin had not readjusted to North American distances .", "Observations about personal space began about twenty years ago .", "Anthropologist Edward T .", "Fairly soon she figured out what was happening ."], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["culture", "gender", "age", "education"]}, "test/high/18574.txt/3": {"passage": "When she returned home after a year in South America , Judith Martin , a North American writer , began to have a problem .

Outdoor sports give children , teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine , which improve their over - all health .

Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity .

If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports . The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports .

They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun , and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing . Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity . While track and field events may not be some small children ' s cup of tea , there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards . The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time . The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each , for a total of 6 . Eight - year - old Jerel Rhodes II , won gold medals for the shot put , and the discus throw . Seven - year - old Jadyn Rhodes , received a silver medal fro the shot put , and a bronze medal in the 400 - meter race . Five - year - old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800 - meter race , as well as the discuss throw . There is a down side to athletic activities . Not everyone will go home as a winner . If your child does not win a medal , you should not complain about him or her . You should be proud of him or her just for taking part . If a child feels bad about his or her performance , he or she may be teased by other children , or his or her parents may express disappointment . All these can have an effect on self - esteem . The bottom line is to get your children out of the house , and to be involved in activities that keep them moving . Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all . If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports . The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports . Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable , or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them . If you encourage those like the Rhodes family , who have the desire to play sports , they just might bring home a gold , silver or bronze medal .", "question": "What is the main advice that the author gives parents?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making , encourage - - but do not push - - him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports .", "It is true that children used to take part in outdoor sports and games .", "They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player , whey they are part of an organized sport .", "It is never too early for young children to compete in athletic activities .", "Children do better in sports events , when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity .", "There are even sports that young athletes do better in school .", "Young people who join in after - school sports activities will be out of the house .", "Outdoor sports give children , teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine , which improve their over - all health .", "Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all .", "There is a down side to athletic activities .", "The Mayo Clinic , an internationally famous medical research group , says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports .", "While track and field events may not be some small children ' s cup of tea , there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards .", "The bottom line is to get your children out of the house , and to be involved in activities that keep them moving .", "Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable , or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them .", "You should be proud of him or her just for taking part .", "If you encourage those like the Rhodes family , who have the desire to play sports , they just might bring home a gold , silver or bronze medal .", "Rarely can people see children today , enjoying themselves outdoors , on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods .", "Today many young people stay inside watching television , playing computer games , or surfing the Internet .", "The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each , for a total of 6 .", "They will be on the move , running and jumping , which is great exercise .", "Five - year - old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800 - meter race , as well as the discuss throw .", "They also learn about good sportsmanship , teamwork and gaining confidence .", "The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time .", "Not everyone will go home as a winner .", "All these can have an effect on self - esteem .", "It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing .", "Eight - year - old Jerel Rhodes II , won gold medals for the shot put , and the discus throw .", "If your child does not win a medal , you should not complain about him or her .", "Seven - year - old Jadyn Rhodes , received a silver medal fro the shot put , and a bronze medal in the 400 - meter race .", "They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun , and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity .", "If a child feels bad about his or her performance , he or she may be teased by other children , or his or her parents may express disappointment ."], "answer_index": 2, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["Making children take advantage of organized competitive sports.", "The earlier children take part in sports activities, the better they are.", "Encouraging their children to join in sports instead of pushing them", "Forcing children to take part in sports activities if they don't want to."]}, "test/high/11964.txt/0": {"passage": "A long time before I was born , my grandma and grandpa had a young family of four little girls .

Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them . So why do they keep eating it ? The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people . However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all . 1 . Fast food makes you fat . A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance . In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes . You probably know this already . But here ' s something you may not know . 2 . Fast food is addictive . The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it . One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations . \" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it . 3 . Fast food is affecting your kids . According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years . Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen . Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly . Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity . 4 . Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them . One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 . 1 to 14 . 8 percent . So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ? Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly . That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad . 5 . Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy . Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options . The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax . One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium . 6 . Fast food is inhumane to animals . Okay , this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you , but it ' s still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food . 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches . Large factory farms resemble more of a \" business \" than a \" farm . \" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight . They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease , which runs rampant in these conditions . Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence , according to the UN . 7 . Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar . High fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas , desserts , and many other products . Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study . Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar .", "question": "What is the purpose of the passage?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["So what makes up the rest of it , you ask ?", "However , once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you , you may just want to stop eating fast food after all .", "Yet most people who eat fast food know it ' s bad for them .", "\" If you eat fast food once a week or more , you may be addicted to it .", "Okay , this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you , but it ' s still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food .", "The more you eat fast food , the more you crave it .", "Fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options .", "But here ' s something you may not know .", "In others words , fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes .", "That ' s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don ' t go bad .", "So why do they keep eating it ?", "The answer is simple : the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long - term implications for most people .", "One study found that fast food is \" a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations .", "\" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight .", "Fast food marketers know this , and design ads accordingly .", "You probably know this already .", "They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease , which runs rampant in these conditions .", "Fast food makes you fat .", "Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they ' ve seen .", "9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches .", "A 15 - year study of over 3 , 000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance .", "Fast food is affecting your kids .", "Eight in 10 Americans eat fast food at least once a month and half eat it every week according , to a Gallup Poll .", "Fast food \" burgers \" don ' t have much burger in them .", "One study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2 .", "Even \" healthy \" fast food isn ' t that healthy .", "is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas , desserts , and many other products .", "The problem is , their definition of \" healthy \" is quite lax .", "Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non - nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity .", "Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence , according to the UN .", "Fast food is inhumane to animals .", "According to the CDC , childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years .", "One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King , the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing , still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat , and nearly a day ' s worth of sodium .", "Large factory farms resemble more of a \" business \" than a \" farm .", "Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar .", "Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar .", "Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study .", "1 to 14 .", "Fast food is addictive .", "Chemical fillers and preservatives , mostly .", "1 .", "2 .", "3 .", "4 .", "5 .", "High fructose corn syrup (", "6 .", "7 .", "8 percent .", "HFCS )"], "answer_index": 1, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["To help us make right decisions", "To advise us to stop eating fast food", "To tell us how to keep fit", "To encourage us to be humane to animals"]}, "test/high/13424.txt/0": {"passage": "In a mango orchard outside a village there lived a mischievous monkey .

It was less than years ago that I spotted an energetic businessman friend pulling what seemed to be either a large container or a small nuclear bomb on wheels through a railway station . I asked . \" What have you got in there ? Your money or your wife ? \" \" Neither , \" he replied , with the satisfied look of a man who knew he was keeping pace with the latest technology , no matter how ridiculous he looked . \" This is what everyone will have soon - - even you . It ' s called a mobile telephone . \" I don ' t feel sorry for the pace of change . On the contrary , I ' m amazed by those high - tech designers who can somehow fit a camera , music - player , computer and phone into a plastic box no bigger than a packet of cigarette . If those geniuses could also find a way to keep the underground trains running on the first snowy day of winter , they would be making real progress for human beings . What I do regret , however , is that so many household items fall behind so soon . My parents bought a wooden wireless radio in 1947 , the year they were married . In 1973 , the year I went to university , it was still working . It sat in the kitchen like an old friend - - which , in a way , it was . It certainly spoke to us more than we spoke to each other on some mornings . When my mum replaced it with a new - style radio that could also play cassette - tapes , I felt a real sense of loss . Such is the over - excited change of 21st - century technology that there ' s no time to satisfy our emotional needs . Even if Apple ' s new products turn out to be the most significant tablets I very much doubt if they will resist this trend .", "question": "Which of the following is conveyed in the passage?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2160"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["Such is the over - excited change of 21st - century technology that there ' s no time to satisfy our emotional needs .", "It contributes greatly to the uneasy feeling that modem technology is going by faster than we can keep up .", "And the technology changes so unbelievably fast .", "\" I don ' t feel sorry for the pace of change .", "\" \" Neither , \" he replied , with the satisfied look of a man who knew he was keeping pace with the latest technology , no matter how ridiculous he looked .", "Very soon , there is no doubt that Apple ' s tablet will seem as a vital tool of modern living to us as sewing machine did to our grandparents .", "If those geniuses could also find a way to keep the underground trains running on the first snowy day of winter , they would be making real progress for human beings .", "You will be made to feel like some sort of time - traveler from the 1970s .", "At least , it will until someone produces an even smarter , thinner and more essential tablet , which , if recent history is any guide , will be in approximately six months ' time .", "The huge number of electronic items now regularly thrown away by British families is clearly one big problem .", "On the contrary , I ' m amazed by those high - tech designers who can somehow fit a camera , music - player , computer and phone into a plastic box no bigger than a packet of cigarette .", "An average British person was believed to get rid of quite a number of electronic goods in a lifetime .", "It certainly spoke to us more than we spoke to each other on some mornings .", "Even if Apple ' s new products turn out to be the most significant tablets I very much doubt if they will resist this trend .", "When my mum replaced it with a new - style radio that could also play cassette - tapes , I felt a real sense of loss .", "These days we are all conditioned to accept newness , whatever it costs .", "Turn your back for a moment and you find that every electronic item in your possession is as old as a tombstone .", "And so the mountain of electrical rubbish grows .", "It sat in the kitchen like an old friend - - which , in a way , it was .", "What I do regret , however , is that so many household items fall behind so soon .", "I ' ve lost count of the number of TV remote - controls that I ' ve bought , mislaid and replaced without working out what most of the buttons did .", "It was less than years ago that I spotted an energetic businessman friend pulling what seemed to be either a large container or a small nuclear bomb on wheels through a railway station .", "It ' s like walking into a pub and asking for an orange juice .", "\" This is what everyone will have soon - - even you .", "But this has other consequences .", "By the time I ' ve learnt how to use a tool it ' s already broken or lost .", "Even then , the calculation seemed to be conservative .", "But try getting the thing repaired when it goes wrong .", "In 1973 , the year I went to university , it was still working .", "\" What have you got in there ?", "\" Why not buy a new one ?", "Why should you care if people laugh just because you use an old mobile phone ?", "My parents bought a wooden wireless radio in 1947 , the year they were married .", "It ' s called a mobile telephone .", "\" you will get asked .", "Only 35 mobiles in a lifetime ?", "They weighed three tons , stood 7 feet high , and included five fridges , six microwaves , seven PCs , six TVs , 12 kettles , 35 mobile phones and so on .", "Your money or your wife ?", "I asked ."], "answer_index": 3, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["The fast pace of change brings us no good.", "We have to keep up with new technology.", "Household items should be upgraded quickly.", "We should hold on for new technology to last."]}, "test/high/4568.txt/0": {"passage": "The Japanese have always loved fresh fish .

This morning I wake up suddenly , like the alarm clock in my head has given me a little electric shock ; it isn ' t sunny outside . I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey . Hearing my brother is getting up , I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea . He ' s down in the kitchen about five minutes later , wearing his work clothes , eyes mostly closed against the morning . \" Morning . \" I say . \" Uh huh . \" I leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room , and get back beneath the quilt . This morning I want to think a while . Today is Dad ' s birthday ; Mom won ' t mention it . My brother might , just to _ , so I ' ll keep him sweet when he comes in from work . Every year on my dad ' s birthday I draw a picture of him ; each year he looks a bit different . I ' m an artist . It ' s not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle , as they try to teach us to do at school . I just get the message across more clearly than other people . More truthfully . I know it . I read a lot of books too , mainly about artists , and I try to paint like them . When my dad comes back I ' ll be able to say \" this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet \" or \" this is you on your thirty - eighth birthday , when I was fourteen , and you ' d been gone five years , and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti . \" And he ' ll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him . On Saturday mornings he ' d take me to town and I ' d drag him around the art shops . On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons . On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel , a real one , not a kiddie ' s . On my ninth birthday he bought me oils . Some mornings I ' d wake up and there ' d be a book on my pillow about Picasso , or Chagall . \" Draw me , \" he ' d say . \" Aw , Dad , I can ' t . \" I know I should go to school ; I ' m not one of those kids who are scared to go . But , it ' s my dad ' s birthday and I think I must spend it with him . So I spend some time thinking about his hair , which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year ; I know hair doesn ' t age at the same speed every year , but I make his hair longer this year . And in my mind ' s eye I give him an extra few pounds too . But I keep the smile fixed in my head , like it is when he ' s happy . It ' s head and shoulders , so I ' ll put him in a T - shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black .

It shows them another way of life . As a volunteer , I helped to prepare meals . I taught games - - - such as basketball , football and art . I helped the kids with their homework .

He lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing . Oliver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth . One was an old woman , who was nearly always drunk , and the other was a busy local doctor , who was not paid enough to be very interested in Oliver ' s survival . _ However , Oliver managed to draw his first breath , and then announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly . His mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered , \" Let me see the child , and die . \" The doctor turned away from the fire , where he had been warming his hands . \" You must not talk about dying yet , \" he said to her kindly . He gave her the child to hold . Lovingly , she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips , then stared wildly around the room , fell back - - and died . \" Poor dear ! \" said the nurse , hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt . The doctor began to put on his coat . \" The baby is weak and will probably have difficulties , \" he said . \" If so , give it a little milk to keep it quiet . \" Then he looked at the dead woman . \" The mother was a good - looking girl . Where did she come from ? \" \" She was brought here last night , \" replied the old woman . \" She was found lying in the street . She ' d walked some distance , judging by her shoes , which were worn to pieces . Where she came from , where she was going to , or what her name was , nobody knows . \" The doctor lifted the girl ' s left hand . \" The old story , \" he said sadly , shaking his head . \" No wedding ring , I see . Ah ! Good night . \" And so Oliver was left with only the drunken nurse . Without clothes , under his first blanket , he could have been the child of a king or a beggar . But when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothes , yellow with age , he looked exactly what he was - - an orphan in a workhouse , ready for a life of misery , hunger , and neglect . Oliver cried loudly . If he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan , perhaps he would have cried even more loudly . There was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse , so Oliver was sent to a special \" baby farm \" nearby . There , he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing . Mrs Mann , the old woman who \" looked after \" them , was very experienced . She knew what was good for children , and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health . She also knew what was good for herself , so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children ' s food . The board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children , but they always sent the beadle , a kind of local policeman , to announce their visit the day before . So whenever the board arrived , of course , the children were always neat and clean . This was the way Oliver was brought up . Consequently , at the age of nine he was a pale , thin child and short for his age . But despite frequent beatings by Mrs Mann , his spirit was strong , which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all . On Oliver ' s ninth birthday , Mr Bumble , the beadle , came to the house to see Mrs Mann . Through the front window Mrs Mann saw him at the gate , and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her . \" Quick ! Take Oliver and those others upstairs to be washed ! \" she said .

Sorry I haven ' t written for so long . I ' ve been quite busy planning my holiday with may older brother , Coin . Do you still remember the trip I told you about ? I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university . Well , now we ' re ready to go ! We ' re going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things . We will go to Africa first . I can ' t wait ! Have you been there ? We leave London on 15thJuly , and we ' ll be flying toprefix = st1 / Morocco , in Northern Africa . We ' re going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert . It ' s the biggest desert in the world - about the size of The US ! I expect it will be very hot , dry and dusty _ . We ' ll be traveling by camel , with local guides , camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big , thick sleeping bags . I ' ve heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights . I ' ll bring a torch with me so that I ' ll be able to see in the dark . The whole trip will take six days . That means I ' ll have to sit on a came for almost a week - how uncomfortable ! I hope my camel likes me ! After the trip by camel , we ' ve going to travel down the River Nile . We ' ll start at Lake Victoria . A little way down the river from Victoria , the water actually gets quite rough . So , we ' ll go white - water rafting . It ' s quite dangerous , but very exciting ! We have to wear special clothing , a helmet and a life jacket , just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white - water rafting , we ' re going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya . We ' ll live with the local people in their villages , and eat and drink like they do , including cow ' s blood ! Do you think I should drink it ? Since we ' ll be walking every day for almost two weeks , I ' ll need to buy a large , strong , light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water . During the day , we ' ll walk across the land , following the footprints of big animals such as elephants , lions and giraffes . We ' ll try to get as close as possible to the animals , even though they ' re dangerous , so that I can take some really good photos . But don ' t worry about me - - our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close . I really want to see an elephant up close . Colin wants to see a giraffe . After that , we ' ll be moving on to Tanzania , where we ' re going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro . Mountain climbing can be very tiring , and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner , so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset . The African part of our trip will take about four weeks . Then we ' re going to the Himalayas . I ' ll send you postcards from all the different places we visit !
