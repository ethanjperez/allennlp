Don ' t stop or finish the other person ' s sentences . Listen carefully to what the other person is saying . Try to see the other person ' s side of the disagreement .

In 1997 , the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world . Now , the 3 - D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10 . As anyone who has seen the movie knows , the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on its first _ in 1912 , killing 1 , 517 people . A century after the accident , scientists have found something new to blame for the sinking : the moon . Donald Olson , a Texas State University physicist , led a team of astronomers to examine the moon ' s role , according to Reuters . Normally , icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide frees them . A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward .

For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate . They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds . The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red . Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April . Another person might see different colours while listening to music . Some people also taste colours . To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow . Some people experience feelings in colour . For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange . Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes . Some people see music as squares and circles . Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball . There are other forms of synesthesia , as well . For one man , different words have different tastes . Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs . Synesthesia is not a common condition . Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it . For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "question": "What is this passage mainly about?", "advantage": 0, "debate_mode": ["\u2162"], "stances": [], "em": 0, "sentences_chosen": ["For example , one person with synesthesia reports feeling pain as the colour orange .", "Some people experience feelings in colour .", "One person says her name is the colour red .", "The most common form of synesthesia is to hear sounds as colours , A person with synesthesia might hear the number three as blue or the letter D as red .", "Some people also taste colours .", "For these people , the senses of smell , sound , sight , touch , and taste are not separate .", "This means they experience two senses at the same time .", "There are other forms of synesthesia , as well .", "To one person , beef might taste blue and to another , yellow .", "Another person might see different colours while listening to music .", "What colour is your name ?", "Another form of synesthesia is to experience sounds or tastes as shapes .", "What colour is Wednesday ?", "For another person , Wednesday is blue .", "For these people , the everyday world can be a colourful and interesting place .", "These people have a condition called synesthesia .", "Some people taste a sweet as a smooth ball .", "Someone might always see green upon hearing the word April .", "Perhaps only one person in every 5 , 000 has it .", "Some people see music as squares and circles .", "For one man , different words have different tastes .", "They might see and also hear colours , for example , or hear as well as feel sounds .", "These questions might sound strange to most people , but some can answer right away .", "Synesthesia is not a common condition .", "Some words taste like pork ; others taste like potatoes or eggs ."], "answer_index": 0, "prob": 0.0, "options": ["An unusual condition.", "People who like colour.", "The colour of pain.", "Music and art."]}, "test/middle/5785.txt/1": {"passage": "What colour is your name ?

But I was wrong . This trip was the best holiday I have ever had . During the holiday , I met a very special friend . While I was walking in the countryside , I saw a man carrying a small brown bag . Wearing white clothes , the man looked like a ghost . As he looked at me , I felt frightened . I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me . \" Hello . Beautiful day , isn ' t it ? \" he said . The man talked a lot . I wasn ' t listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag . I wanted to see what was inside it ! He saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see . Out came a lively , beautiful puppy . The brown puppy was small and only about two months old . The man then asked me , \" Would you like to keep this puppy ? \" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance . I thanked him , took the puppy and ran home .

On the highways between cities , the speedlimit is usually 55 miles per hour . When people drive faster than the speedlimit , a policeman can stop them . The policemen give them pieces of paper which people call traffic tickets . Traffic tickets tell the drivers how much money they must pay .

I was still very upset about what happened on the road , so I made myself a drink . Then I went upstairs to have a bath . I saw that the window in the bedroom was open . This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out . She was afraid of burglars . When I went to close it , I found Ellen . She was lying on the floor . There was blood everywhere . I rushed over and felt for her pulse but she was dead . I sat on the floor beside her body and was too frightened to do anything .

He loved to look at the world around him . When he went to college in Paris , he showed interest in looking through a microscope . A microscope makes things look a lot bigger ; it lets you see things you can ' t see just with your eyes . Looking through a microscope , Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water . He saw and drew pictures of the small living things - - he called them \" microbes \" or \" germs \" - - that crowded in a drop of water . One day a winemaker came into the lab , hoping that someone could help him with his problem . \" Sometimes my wine tastes delicious , but sometimes terrible , \" he said to Pasteur . \" Can you help me find out why ? \" Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope . He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs . If he killed these germs , maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible . He tried with different ways to kill the germs .

When the heat rises into the air , it is stopped by some special gases in the atmosphere like CO2 , the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm . Power stations and cars release so many greenhouse gases every day . So we can help stop global warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room , asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy . We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation . For example , ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car . Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees . Because trees take in CO2 , they are our best friends when fighting against global warming . The problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day . It may take a long time to find clean energy , such as wind energy . It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down .

I know that you want to have your own club , but you don ' t know how to start one . Do you know what makes a club , such as an English Club or a Basketball Club , successful ? Here is some advice . * Decide what kind of club to have , and come up with a nice name . Since you are interested in music , why not start a Music Club ? A club is to bring people with common interests together . * Look for members . You can start with your friends , but it isn ' t really a club until people you don ' t know want to join . * Make rules . Get together with the members and agree on rules . Make sure that if someone breaks any rule , he or she should be _ . * Have regular meetings . For the first time , you should make sure that all the members attend .

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks ; it has taken on different meanings through the years . Today , one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true . In order to please Artemis , the goddess of the moon , the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays . A moon - shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles . They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering up into the sky , where they believed Artemis lived . The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe , where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person ' s birthday , partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits . It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one ' s prayers to the gods . Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten . Traditionally , one candle represents a year of the person ' s age . Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck . But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday .

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks ; it has taken on different meanings through the years . Today , one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true . In order to please Artemis , the goddess of the moon , the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays . A moon - shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles . They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering up into the sky , where they believed Artemis lived . The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe , where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person ' s birthday , partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits . It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one ' s prayers to the gods . Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten . Traditionally , one candle represents a year of the person ' s age . Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck .

Do you use ten different words to do it ? Can you do it in English , or do you have to use your first language ? Do you count on your fingers ? Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world . But scientists have discovered that it is not true . People in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers . In the United States , people begin counting with their first finger , which they extend or stick out . They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb to count to five . Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten . In China , people count by using different finger positions . In this way , a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand .

Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself ? Well , obviously it ' s because we have mirror neurons in our brains . Put simply , the presence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something , our brains model after it , whether or not we actually perform the same action . This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile , talk , walk , dance or play sports . But the idea goes further : mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions , they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people . Mirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains , but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages , and to understand how other people feel . Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language . A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to ( for example : \" The hand took hold of the ball \" ) , the same mirror neurons were _ as when the action was actually performed ( in this example , actually taking hold of a ball ) . Any problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior . Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning . However , it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders .
