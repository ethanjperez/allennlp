But the computer is placed in Sunnyside, about 80 kilometers away. What the scientists input is sent by telephone lines to the computer, and after a time, copies of the designs are needed back in Felton as possible. Lockheed people have tried several ways of sending the prints  , but the most effective seems to be by pigeon  . Are pigeons really used to carry messages in these days? They are, and they send the prints faster and cheaper than any other way. Human   messengers (persons carrying messages) are much more expensive and slower than the pigeons.

The answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night. While we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust. For a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later. As I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys. When I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died. For a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son. My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here. \"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye. It's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons. First: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me. Second: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital. From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.", "annotated_passage": "0: \"What is the most

I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night. While we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust. For a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself.

All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later. As I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys. When I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died. For a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son. My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry.

Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me. Second: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life.

The relationships that you make in your teenage years will be a special pan of your life. They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. What makes a relationship healthy? Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life. Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are.

One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source, such as a light bulb. The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown. The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice. The message will appear in a different color1. Tips:\nIf you are using the heating method, avoid burning the paper. Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid-base   reaction, producing a color1 change in the paper. Grape juice concentrate   results in a more visible color1 change than regular grape juice.", "annotated_passage": "0: Do you want to write your password down so that no one can see it, or do you want to send someone a secret message?\n1: Knowing how to make an invisible ink message will have you feeling like a secret agent in no time.\n2: These are instructions for making invisible ink using baking soda.\n3: Difficulty: Easy\nTime required: A few minutes \nWhat you need:\nBaking soda, Paper, Water, Light bulb, Paintbrush, Measuring cup, Purple grape juice\nHere's how:\nThere are at least two methods of using baking soda as invisible ink.\n4: Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda.\n5: Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper, using the baking soda solution   as \"ink\".\n6: Allow the ink to dry.\n7: One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source, such as a light bulb.\n8: The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown.\n9: The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice.\n10: The message will appear in a different color1.\n11: Tips:\nIf you are using the heating method, avoid burning the paper.\n12: Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid-base   reaction, producing a color1 change in the paper.\n13: Grape juice concentrate   results in a more visible color1 change than regular grape juice.", "passage_sentences": ["Do you want to write your password down so that no one can see it, or do you want to send someone a secret message?", "Knowing how to make an invisible ink message will have you feeling like a secret agent in no time.", "These are instructions for making invisible ink using baking soda.", "Difficulty: Easy\nTime required: A few minutes \nWhat you need:\nBaking soda, Paper, Water, Light bulb, Paintbrush, Measuring cup, Purple grape juice\nHere's how:\nThere are at least two methods of using baking soda as invisible ink.", "Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda.", "Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper, using the baking soda solution   as \"ink\".", "Allow the ink to dry.", "One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source, such as a light bulb.", "The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown.", "The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice.", "The message will appear in a different color1.", "Tips:\nIf you are using the heating method, avoid burning the paper.", "Baking soda and grape juice react in an acid-base   reaction, producing a color1 change in the paper.", "Grape juice concentrate   results in a more visible color1 change than regular grape juice."], "question": "From the process, we can know that making invisible ink is_.", "options": ["very hard", "not difficult", "a little difficult", "not easy"], "debate_mode": ["\u2162"]}}
